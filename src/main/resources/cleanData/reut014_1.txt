<TITLE>proxmire outlines insider trading legislation</TITLE>
<BODY>senate banking committee chairman william proxmire (d-wis) said he planned to introduce legislation shortly to require greater public disclosure of corporate takeovers and fairer treatment for all shareholders.     speaking to the national association of manufacturers, proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increased the chance that congress will act to curb abuses.     "we are proposing legislation that would provide for more disclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and would insure that takeovers are properly financed," he said.     among the provisions, the bill would reduce the threshold for notifying the securities and exchange commission that a investor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in a company to three pct from the current five pct threshold within 10 days, proxmire said.     in addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirement that an investor intended to aquire three pct that would have to filed with the sec.     proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant to prevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public in knowing about coming takeover attempts.     proxmire said he would call for extending the period that a tender offer must be kept open under the williams act to 60 business days from the current 20 business days.     his bill would provide for private suits if the acquiring company violated the time period on the tender offer.     to correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, proxmire said the legislation would aim at insuring current margin requirments are properly enforced.     the federal reserve board has a 50 pct margin requirement for purchasing stock, but proxmire said it is not generally enforced in hostile takeovers.     rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeover declare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without actually putting any of their own money, proxmire said.     he said his bill would allow private suits for damages for failure to meet the federal reserve's 50 pct margin requirements.     the bill also would require more disclose when several investors form an alliance in a hostile takeover.     "when pickens and icahn get together we want people to know about it," proxmire said.     proxmire said he favored the approach used in britain towards two-tiered tender offers that insures that all shareholders recieve equal treatment.     he said he expected amendments to the bill also would cover defensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills.     proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later this month and predicted the senate committee would act this spring.     he said he was hopeful congress could pass a bill this year.  reuter </BODY>

"the proposition represents a major step forward. but african countries should not be the ones to ask for large-scale debt write-offs," he said. africa's total external debt was estimated at 175 billion dlrs at the end of 1986.     the eca-adb report said prospects would remain bleak for african economies in 1987 but predicted gross domestic product (gdp) growth ranging between 2.5 and four pct, compared with 1.2 pct last year.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>new immigration rules relating to alien farm workers and reportedly being drafted by the u.s. agriculture department are meeting with objections in congress, sources on capitol hill said.     usda is drafting regulations, required by a 1986 law, that would offer amnesty to illegal aliens if they worked in the cultivation of fruits, vegetables and other perishable commodities.     the department is considering including in its definition of perishable commodities such farm products as tobacco, hops, spanish reeds and christmas trees, while excluding sugar cane, the new york times reported yesterday.     rep. howard berman, d-calif., would like to see the definition extended to include sugar cane, cultivation of which is "a breeding ground for one of the scandals of the nation," gene smith, a spokesman for berman, said.     livestock, dairy and poultry producers have been lobbying usda hard to have their products covered by the amnesty provision, farm industry sources said.     chuck fields of the american farm bureau federation said livestock producers were "desperate" because they fear they will be unable to retain the many illegal aliens who have joined that industry.     a house staff member involved in drafting the landmark 1986 immigration law who asked not to be identified said congress did not mean to extend special amnesty provisions to workers who helped cultivate tobacco, and that inclusion of hops and spanish reeds was "marginal."     in addition, lawmakers made it clear during consideration of the bill that lumber workers were not to be covered by the the amnesty provisions, making the inclusion of christmas trees "a tough call," this source said.     usda officials declined to comment on the draft regulation except to say it was subject to change before it will be released, probably some time later this month.     while lawmakers may object to the usda rule under consideration relating to perishable commodities, congress is not likely to reopen debate on the controversial immigration question, congressional sources said.     the amnesty provision specially designed for farm workers was crucial to passage of the overall immigration bill.     congressional staff members estimate the special farm worker amnesty provision would apply to between 250,000 to 350,000 aliens. the law would allow eligible farm workers who worked for 90 days during the year ending may 1, 1986, to apply for temporary, then permanent, resident status.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>yugoslav workers may be angered by lost subsidies</TITLE>
<BODY>yugoslav government plans to stop subsidising loss-making firms will anger hundreds of thousands of workers, western diplomats said.     the law, proposed by prime minister branko mikulic, goes into effect on july 1 and aims to end a long-standing practice of supporting unprofitable companies. under the law, wage cuts will be imposed on losing enterprises, while those failing to recover within a six-month grace period will face liquidation.     the diplomats said mikulic's attempt to create a market economy is inevitable, but has still come as a shock to those accustomed to government subsidies.     "it was a bitter pill which had to be swallowed, but if an overdose is taken too abruptly, it may have adverse effects on the system," a western diplomat said.     he said if the law was applied too strictly it would probably provoke a new wave of strikes and unrest.     yugoslavia was swept by strikes last month following the introduction of a wage-freeze law, later amended to allow more flexibility and some exemptions in what some political analysts saw as a retreat by mikulic.     but with inflation moving towards 100 pct, trade union leaders have asked how much more deprivation workers can take.     the union leaders said workers thoughout the country are already receiving salaries below limits set under existing law, while others have received no wages at all this year because their employers are unable to pay them.     workers also complain much of their income is taken in local, state and federal taxes.     many others are losing their motivation to work and confidence in government as they feel their decision-making powers are being eroded, trade union officials said.     meanwhile, the official tanjug news agency reported a paper and cellulose factory at ivangrad in the montenegro republic closed yesterday and 2,000 of its workers were given "temporary leave."     tanjug said the plant had been running at a loss for the 24 years it had been in operation, and its closure was the result of "economic necessity" rather than bankruptcy.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>leading industrial nations will be reviewing the paris agreement to stabilize exchange rates, foster increased worldwide growth and reduce trade imbalances but the u.s. thinks the accord has been successful so far, a senior u.s. treasury official said.     "the paris accord will be reviewed at this meeting. it has been successful and continues to be succesfull," a senior u.s. treasury official told reporters.     in a briefing ahead of this week's semiannual imf and world bank meetings, he also said the u.s. was looking to west germany and japan to bolster their economic growth.     the official said both surplus countries, like west germany and japan, and deficit countries, like the u.s., agreed to play a role in bringing about more balanced economic growth.     he reaffirmed the u.s. would press ahead with efforts to reduce its budget deficit, resist protectionism and boost u.s. competitiveness.     the official also said that he expected trade issues, like the dispute between the u.s. and japan over microchips, to be included in the discussions.     the official made no direct comment on the content or schedule of forthcoming group of five and group of seven discussions. he said that industrial countries are concerned that the large external imbalances remain a threat to the international monetary system.     he added that the meetings will also provide an opportunity to discuss economic policy coordination efforts.     the official said indicators would be used to measure policy objectives of industrial countries and their economic projections.     they would also be used to assess progress of policy goals.     asked whether the u.s. was proposing a new initiative regarding the indicators, the official said the issue would be reported to the venice summit in june. monetary sources said the u.s. proposal envisages using the indicators to make policy coordination agreements, like the paris accord, more binding.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>seoul stock market consolidates on state measures</TITLE>
<BODY>the south korean stock market seems to be consolidating following government measures to cool its rapid rise this year, domestic and foreign analysts said.     the composite index hit a record 405.13 early last week, nearly 50 pct up from the new year when it stood at 264.82, but plunged to a 383.48 close on april 3, the day after the government intervened.     under the measures, industrial firms with bank loans worth 50 billion won or more must either offer new shares or issue convertible bonds to repay the loans.     securities houses will have to sell shares they are holding if the volume exceeds 40 pct of their paid-in capital. the ceiling for investment trust firms was fixed at 50 pct.     south korean firms have traditionally preferred obtaining low interest bank loans -- the current rate is 10 pct -- to issuing bonds at a higher rate or floating share issues with the attendant dividend pressures and launch expenses.     the seoul stock exchange, with 355 listed stocks, grew explosively in the first three months of the year, building on an already impressive 68.9 pct gain in 1986.     analysts now expect the market to pause temporarily and then resume its upward movement, despite the indirect government regulation.     they said the continuous growth of the nation's gross national product (gnp) and trade surplus, improved exports and good performances by industrial firms all fuelled the boom.     the trade surplus widened to 460 mln dlrs in march from 110 mln in february, while government economists expect gnp to grow nine pct this year.     analysts said the deep slump in the real estate market also increased liquidity in the stock market.     "many investors are still confident the market will not lose its strength. it seems likely to pause for a while and then rebound again," said park sin-bom, a director of lucky securities co.     "there are more positive factors than negative. the market is still buoyed by ample liquidity thanks to the economy's strong performance."     the stock market began to recover during saturday's half-day session with the index closing at 397.24 in active trading on monday, but closed lower on tuesday at 390.24 on turnover of 76 billion won.     "i would say the market is flat for the time being.... it is very prone to profit-taking after the sharp gains in the first three months and the various government measures," a foreign analyst said.     "but the market will head up again after a rest because the fundamentals are expected to rise and investors will be as bullish as ever at the slightest sign of a market recovery."     he added that the newly launched 30 mln dlr korea europe fund would have an impact on the south korean stock market, despite its small volume compared with the 5.72 trillion won of listed capital on the seoul exchange.     local dealers recommend blue chips and financial shares as these stand to benefit most from continuing trade friction between the united states and japan and the rumoured restructuring of local finance houses.     dealers also cite the shares of domestically oriented firms, which are less vulnerable to the effects of the gradual appreciation of the won.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>german engineering wage-round talks break down</TITLE>
<BODY>talks between employers and unions in the west german engineering industry over pay and working hours broke down without result late last night, an official from the ig-metall union said.     ig-metall, western europe's largest union, is reviving its campaign for a 35-hour working week and is demanding a five pct pay increase. strikes for a 35-hour week in 1984 brought west germany's automobile industry virtually to a standstill.     the result of the 1984 campaign was a compromise reduction in working hours to 38.5 from 40.     the talks which broke down yesterday were in the key north wuerttemberg/north baden area, which generally sets the trend for the rest of the country.     ig-metall official ernst eisenmann, speaking last night, blamed the failure of the negotiations on the employers. he said they had been uncompromising on the question of the shorter week.     hans-peter stihl, negotiating for the employers, said any plan to reduce working hours gradually to 35 hours was unacceptable.      the employers have not made an official offer on cutting the working week, but sources involved in the negotiations say that they are working on the basis of a possible half-hour reduction from next year and a pay increase of 2.7 pct in 1987 and of 1.5 pct in 1988.     the union will propose that the negotiations be officially declared a failure and then a process of arbitration is likely.     ig-metall has said that cutting the working week will create jobs in west germany where more than two mln people are unemployed. ig-metall itself has about 2.5 mln members.     ig-metall has already been staging a series of "warning strikes" to press home demands for the 35-hour week.     yesterday, 23,000 engineering workers struck at 90 plants for one to two hours, according to an ig-metall statement.     among the strikers were 4,000 at a daimler-benz ag daig.f, plant in bremen, and 3,100 at ford motor co's f> ford-werke ag plant in saarlouis.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>yugoslavia, which refinanced part of its 19.7 billion dlr debt in talks with creditor governments last week, has begun talks with banks on rescheduling its commercial debt, the official tanjug news agency said.     the talks began in washington yesterday and tanjug said the general attitude of the banks was "favourable."     at the same time, other tanjug reports showed yugoslavia is having difficulties in obtaining a 600 mln ecu loan from the european community (ec) and in receiving money owed to yugoslav firms by middle eastern countries.     the western creditor governments and kuwait agreed on march 31 to refinance 475 mln dlrs of yugoslavia's debt due in 1987 and 1988. this made possible the talks with commercial banks.     tanjug said sources close to the yugoslav delegation said the initial reaction of commercial banks was favourable despite their continued insistence on "technical and legal elements."     it said it was believed that a commercial debt rescheduling would be formally agreed in the next few weeks. bank debt accounts for about 70 pct of yugoslavia's overall debt, which stood at 19.7 billion dlrs at end-1986.     tanjug said yugoslavia also discussed with its commercial creditors the idea of converting some of yugoslavia's debt into joint venture investments but it gave no details of this.     it said deputy finance minister boris skapin was holding talks on this with representatives of manufacturers hanover trust co., which coordinates the interests of several hundred banks in yugoslav debt negotiations.     in a separate report tanjug said the ec has so far refused a yugoslav request for a 600 mln ecu infrastuctural loan and a 100 mln ecu grant from the ec budget. the ec had so far only agreed to provide 380 mln ecus towards transport modernisation.     it said yugoslav finance minister svetozar rikanovic yesterday met world bank and international monetary fund officials in washington.     it said the world bank agreed that infrastructural projects in yugoslavia should be accelerated and structural adjustment loans should be agreed this year.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>a group of canadian lawmakers from ontario today asked their u.s. counterparts to exempt canada from the mandatory trade retaliation provisions in a major trade bill being considered by the u.s. congress.     at a meeting of the northeast-midwest coalition, an organization of u.s. legislators, david cooke, chairman of the ontario parliament's select committee on economic affairs, said the exemption would help trade relations.     the trade legislation to be considered by the full house in late april would require president reagan to retaliate against foreign unfair trade practices unless the trade actions would harm the u.s. economy.     currently, reagan can reject trade sanctions on any grounds.     cooke, a member of the liberal party, told the u.s. congressmen, "i can understand (the trade bill). i think it has to do with concerns you have with the other parts of the world."     "i would suggest to you that we are your best friends. you do not have those concerns with canada and you should sincerely consider exempting our country from that bill," he added.     canada is the united states' largest trading partner, with two-way trade more than 113 billion dlrs in 1985, according to the coalition. but the u.s. ran up a 23 billion dlr deficit in manufactured goods that year compared to a 14 billion dlr surplus in services trade with its neighbour.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>u.s. debt futures closed down and near daily lows after a choppy session.     continued weakness in the dollar pressured the market. bearish sentiment prevailed despite remarks made by federal reserve chairman paul volcker that a further large drop in the dollar could be counterproductive to the world economy.     new agreements by the g-5 and g-7 nations, which are meeting this week, on stabilizing currency rates are expected to have little effect on the market, traders said.     june t-bonds again failed to take out resistance at 98-16/32 as well as fill a chart gap between 98-25/32 and 99-16/32.     cbt t-bonds closed 28/32 to 30/32 point lower, t-notes fell 20/32 and muni bonds ended down one point. imm t-bills ranged from 7 basis points lower to 2 basis points higher and eurodollars closed down 6 to 11 basis points.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>japan division of labour with asia urged</TITLE>
<BODY>japan should promote division of labour with its asian neighbours, especially the newly industrialized countries, to help achieve more balanced world economic growth, the bank of japan said in a report.     instead of trying to produce everything by itself, japan should open up its market further to imports, transfer manufacturing facilities abroad and increase technology transfer with those nations, the bank said in its monthly report.     japan should not see industrializing asian nations as mere competitors in its overseas and domestic markets but as countries that can contribute to the region's prosperity.     the bank said trade relations between japan and the asian neighbouring countries have so far been vertical, meaning that japan imports primary goods from those countries and exports manufactured goods to them.     but this has resulted in an increase in their trade deficits with japan while some newly industrialized asian nations have accumulated trade surpluses with countries like the united states.  reuter </BODY>

"think of the vast waste of financial and other resources," he said.     yeutter said much of the problem underlying the dispute with japan over semiconductors was due to overproduction.     the trade representative called for a long-term approach to international trade and said the recent commitment to a free-trade agreement between the united states and canada was a step in the right direction.     there's a lot of work to be done in the next six months, but we have set october 1 as a target date for an agreement to be reached, he added.

<TITLE>japan to revise long-term energy demand downwards</TITLE>
<BODY>the ministry of international trade and industry (miti) will revise its long-term energy supply/demand outlook by august to meet a forecast downtrend in japanese energy demand, ministry officials said.     miti is expected to lower the projection for primary energy supplies in the year 2000 to 550 mln kilolitres (kl) from 600 mln, they said.     the decision follows the emergence of structural changes in japanese industry following the rise in the value of the yen and a decline in domestic electric power demand.     miti is planning to work out a revised energy supply/demand outlook through deliberations of committee meetings of the agency of natural resources and energy, the officials said.     they said miti will also review the breakdown of energy supply sources, including oil, nuclear, coal and natural gas.     nuclear energy provided the bulk of japan's electric power in the fiscal year ended march 31, supplying an estimated 27 pct on a kilowatt/hour basis, followed by oil (23 pct) and liquefied natural gas (21 pct), they noted.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>brazil's debt crisis becoming political crisis</TITLE>
<BODY>brazil's financial crisis is rapidly becoming a political and social crisis, and president jose sarney faces increasingly serious questions about his future.     as brazil enters debt talks with creditors in the united states this week, political analysts say sarney's administration has never appeared weaker.     the full political price which sarney will have to pay for the failure of the much-vaunted anti-inflation cruzado plan is still not clear. he might have to pay with the presidency.     calls are increasing for direct presidential elections to pick a successor to sarney early next year. the length of his term will be decided by a constituent assembly, and sarney has been lobbying for a six-year term.     sarney came to power, without facing presidential elections, in march 1985, when the military bowed out after 21 years of rule.     although there was wide public support for direct  elections for president, the military as one of their last acts, insisted an electoral college, where it felt it had more influence, make the choice.     the college chose tancredo neves, a popular politician who headed the brazilian democratic movement party (pmdb), which had opposed military rule.     in part to smooth relations with the military, neves chose sarney, a supporter of the generals, for the purely ceremonial post of vice-president. but neves died before he could take office and sarney took power.     he won the grudging support of the pmdb and the cruzado plan was wildly popular with inflation-weary brazilians.     but the cruzado plan failed and politics in brazil has not been the same.     "the country is a rudderless ship," said a u.s. diplomat, echoing a common view that the government lacks any clear idea of how to tackle the economic crisis.     sarney has appeared increasingly isolated, with criticism coming from the business community, the trade unions, some of the military, the media and political opponents.     many businessmen are unhappy with sarney's decision announced on february 20 to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign debt.     a motor industry executive said: "the business community thinks brazil should go to the imf. their rules are sometimes harsh and strict, but this is the only way to put the house in order."     trade unions generally support the debt moratorium, but disagree with other aspects of government policy. since the end of february they have organized national strikes of seamen, bankworkers and federal university teachers and countless local stoppages and protests.     economic problems have prompted criticism from some military figures, including the last army ruler, general joao figueiredo. it is a sign of the times that almost daily military men deny there is going to be a coup.     if the army does stay in the barracks, the key arbitors of sarney's fate will be the pmdb's leaders. so far, they have not taken a clear stand on the issue of direct elections.     but one pmdb leader, senator affonso camargo, pointedly said yesterday that it was the sovereign right of the consituent assembly to call direct elections for the presidency whenever it wished.     in the media, sarney has to contend with strong criticism.     one senior political commentator, fernando pedreira of the jornal do brasil, wrote in the newspaper last week:     "president sarney is ... a man of good intentions, but it is just possible that he himself is not aware of the true state of the country and the people since the immense failure of the cruzado plan.     "the disappointment, the frustration, the irritation, the enticement have been (and continue to be) too great, too profound."he called for direct elections early in 1988 as the only way out of the present crisis.     one of sao paulo's leading news magazines, senhor, said in an editorial this week: "the anarcho-populist government of president jose sarney has failed. two years have already been too long for such a disastrous experience.     "it deserves to be buried as quickly as possible. the natural solution: direct elections soon."     the government's inability to control inflation is now bringing with it serious social problems.     an explosion in rents in sao paulo has thrown tens of thousands of families onto the streets because they can no longer afford to pay even for a wooden shack in the slums.     the local press says the city is experiencing the biggest wave of land invasions in its history.    according to rental agencies, rents have increased 500 pct in little more than a year. even the cheapest shacks now cost 2,000 cruzados (90 dollars) a month, half as much again as the minimum wage, which is all that many earn.     cardinal paulo evaristo arns, the roman catholic archbishop of sao paulo, warned yesterday of the possibility of "a social conflict of unimaginable proportions."     with his back to the wall politically and with social tensions rising, sarney is no position to compromise on debt.  reuter </BODY>

"joint ventures are the principal instrument for allowing the resources of the industrialized countries to be channeled to the developing world so as to lead future growth for both," reviglio said.     eni's subsidiary ecofuel will join pequiven, the petrochemical subsidiary of pdvsa in building a 160 mln dlr plant to produce mtbe, a gasoline additive used to increase octane levels.     the 500,000 mt per year plant will be constructed at jose in eastern venezuela, and fed by butane produced at pdvsa's eastern cryogenic complex. eni owns 48 pct of the joint venture company, super octanos, c.a., while pequiven has 49 pct, with the remaining three pct to be sold to private investors.     production is set to begin in third quarter 1989. ecofuel officials said the plant is modeled after one in saudi arabia.     another eni subsidiary, agip carbone, will sign a letter of intent in caracas tomorrow to enter a partnership with pdvsa to mine the coal deposits at guasare in western zulia state, he said.     feasibility studies are still being done on the carbozulia project, with a definitive accord slated for august, he added.     agip carbone and atlantic richfield coal, an arco subsidiary have formed a consortium which will own 48 pct of the carbozulia project, whose total cost is estimated at 500 mln dlrs, the company said. agip carbone will invest 24 pct, or 120 mln dlrs, in the project, it said.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>asean shows mixed performance in 1986</TITLE>
<BODY>a sharp oil price decline and sharp fluctuations of exchange and interest rates in 1986 produced a mixed economic performance by the association of southeast asian nations (asean), a united nations study said.     the annual report of the u.n. economic and social commission for asia and the pacific (escap) said the international economic environment reversed the fortunes of the trade-oriented economies of the six asean member countries.     it said the already low 1985 growth rates of asean's oil exporting countries -- brunei, malaysia and indonesia -- dropped further after the oil price fall.     three oil importers -- singapore, the philippines and thailand -- improved their performance mainly by restructuring their economies. but the report said the oil price fall reduced export earnings, worsening economic prospects for the exporters.     the exporters' non-oil commodity prices did not show major improvement and protectionist pressures from industrial countries restricted export of manufactured products, it said.     the gdps of indonesia, which was 1.9 pct in 1985, and malaysia, which fell a real one pct, barely grew in 1986.     the two countries, buffeted by unfavourable external factors in the past few years, were forced to curb aggregate domestic consumption demands last year to avoid severe balance of payments pressures and to resort to extensive commercial borrowings.     the u.n. body said the economic outlooks of singapore, thailand and the philippines improved steadily in 1986 as the year advanced. it said the most favourable factor benefiting the three was the realignment of key currencies, especially the appreciation of the yen, which has resulted in the increased competitiveness of their exports against those from japan.     the report said the downward spiral plaguing the philippine economy since 1983 was reversed into an estimated 0.9 pct gdp growth in 1986 with agriculture and public utilities becoming growth sectors.     it said the resumption of the philippines' sustained growth rests largely on a satisfactory solution of its debt problem.     escap said the yen appreciation, together with economic restructuring measures, played a big role in helping singapore recover faster than expected from its 1.8 pct gdp decline in 1985.     it said the singapore gdp achieved a growth of over one pct last year after registering positive growth from the second quarter.     the singapore economic revival was hampered by its own adjustment measures especially its two-year wage freeze enforced last april, a glut of its property market and depressed conditions in its asean neighbours which hurt singapore because they take about a quarter of its total exports.     the report said thailand benefited from the changing world economic environment far more than any of its asean neighbours.     the thai performance stemmed from the expansion o its non-traditional export items last year to cover more manufactured products and its greater exploration of unsaturated export markets such as asia, the middle east and the european community.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>tanzania raises prices to keep budget deficit down</TITLE>
<BODY>the tanzanian government raised the price of beer, soft drinks and cigarettes by 20 pct and telephone and telex calls by 10 pct in an attempt to keep its budget deficit for this financial year roughly on target.     the deficit for the financial year ending on june 30 was initially forecast at 3,350 mln shillings and the new measures will raise some 700 mln shillings in extra revenue, a statement from the ministry of finance, economic affairs and planning said.     according to the statement, the price increases, which take immediate effect, were needed because the government had lost tax revenue through lower than expected industrial production. water and power problems and a shortage of spare parts had reduced the output of tanzanian factories, it said.     the ministry also announced a new 30 pct tax on goods imported by non-resident businessmen and said the government would take steps against importers who have been evading duty in collusion with corrupt customs officials.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>dollar slightly lower at new york midsession</TITLE>
<BODY>the dollar remained on the defensive in subdued dealings with few traders willing to take any major risks ahead of this week's international monetary meetings in washington, dealers said.     "everybody is waiting for developments from the talks. in the meantime, it's just jobbing positions back and forth," said a dealer at one u.s. bank.     the group of five, comprising the u.s., japan, west germany, france and the u.k., are scheduled to convene today.     the dollar hovered at 145.25/30 yen, down from 145.85/90 last night, and eased to 1.8255/60 marks from 1.8260/70.     the stage for the dollar's decline was set overnight in the far east where the u.s. currency retreated despite steady intervention on its behalf by the bank of japan.     dealers in japan cited speculation that the g-5/g-7 talks are unlikely to produce any significant or lasting measures to stabilize currencies as one reason for the sell-off.     no central bank intervention was detected in the u.s. where the dollar kept well within recent trading parameters.     despite the view that trade and economic imbalances dictate a downward course for the dollar, few u.s. dealers wished to sell it aggressively before this week's meetings.     statements by federal reserve board chairman paul volcker during testimony before the senate banking committe failed to rouse the market from its inertia.     volcker reiterated that a further, sizeable dollar decline may be counter-productive. he also said that currency changes that have occurred so far should be large enough -- in a context of a growing world economy and fiscal restraint in the u.s. -- to support expectations for a narrower u.s. trade gap.     "there was nothing new or remarkable there," said a dealer at one european bank. the dollar's brief rise to 1.8270 marks was already underway when volcker spoke, he added.     with the dollar becalmed, dealers looked to cross-rates, especially sterling, yen and swiss franc, for interest.     sterling continued to benefit from u.k. public opinion polls indicating a lead for the ruling conservative party in any general election and following signals of an improved economy.     the pound hovered at 1.6175/85 dlrs, unchanged from monday, and at 2.955 marks, off slightly from about 2.955 last night.     the dollar eased to 1.5120/30 swiss francs from 1.5180/90, and to 1.3048/53 canadian dollars from 1.3080/85 yesterday.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>stoltenberg sees moves to strengthen paris accord</TITLE>
<BODY>west german finance minister gerhard stoltenberg said today's meetings of major industrial countries would look at ways of strengthening the paris accord on stabilizing foreign exchange rates.     stoltenberg told journalists he saw no fundamental weakness of the february 22 agreement of the group of five countries and canada to keep exchange rates near the then-current levels.     but he declined to say what measures would be discussed ahead of a communique of the group of seven ministers later today.     stoltenberg and bundesbank president karl otto poehl said the importance of the paris agreement, also known as the louvre accord, had been underestimated.     stoltenberg said there is greater agreement now among major countries than six months ago, at the time of the annual meeting of the international monetary fund and world bank, marked by sharp discord between the united states and its major trading partners.     "there is no fundamental weakness of the paris accord," he said. "we will be looking at ways of strengthening it, but i do not want to discuss that here.     stoltenberg said the louvre agreement was working despite a "slight firming" of the yen against the dollar.     and poehl noted that the dollar/mark parity was unchanged since february 22 without the bundesbank having had to sell marks to support the dollar.     "the louvre agreement has been honored by the market," he said.     poehl said west germany had lived up to its side of the bargain in paris by preparing the way for tax cuts to be accelerated as a way of stimulating growth.     poehl said, however, that japan had not yet fulfilled its pledges for economic stimulation.     "and we will have to see if the united states is able to do what they promised in paris on reducing the budget deficit -- and get it through congress," he added.     stoltenberg reiterated west german concern about a further fall in the dollar, noting that the mark was up 85 pct against the dollar and nearly 20 pct on a trade-weighted basis.     "you cannot expect that to go unnoticed in an economy. and it is not just a german problem, it is a european problem," he said.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>britain, japan clash over stock market access</TITLE>
<BODY>britain and japan clashed today over u.k. demands for greater access to the tokyo stock exchange (tse) as trade tensions between the two countries mounted.     british consumer affairs minister michael howard told reporters he was dissatisfied with the exchange's response to britain's non-negotiable timetable for increased british membership and warned of possible reprisals in the future.     he described his meeting with tokyo stock exchange (tse) head michio takeuchi, in which he demanded greater exchange access, as "very frank indeed."     in a separate press conference, tse president michio takeuchi said the exchange has done its utmost to liberalise its membership and called on britain to make some concessions.     according to takeuchi, howard wants three british firms to be named members of the tokyo stock exchange by the end of this year. neither takeuchi nor howard would name the companies.     "next may is the earliest possible date for opening our membership and i want the british government to understand this," takeuchi said.     membership cannot be increased before space on the trading floor is expanded in may 1988, he said.      howard told reporters that was not good enough and said that britain would use its powers to ban japanese financial institutions from london if it was not satisfied with tokyo.     japan has until the next meeting of senior officials from the two countries in may or june to come up with a postive response to the british timetable or face retaliation, he said.     "the timetable was constructed in a way that made it a very reasonable request and i expect it to be met," he said.     asked about the exchange's argument that it has no floor space to expand membership, howard replied, "we find it very difficult in our country to understand why the considerable ingenuity and resourcefulness of the japanese (in world markets) is unable to overcome problems of that kind."     while here, howard said he also expressed frustration with the huge trade imbalance with japan and with tokyo's handling of demands by britain's cable and wireless for a greater role in japan's telecommunications business.     according to japanese newspaper reports, at least some of that message may have penetrated.     according to several reports, the post and telecommunications ministry is considering a cable and wireless proposal for a telephone cable between japan and the u.s.     ministry officials were unavailable for comment.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>california moves against kmg main hurdman</TITLE>
<BODY>california regulators said they were seeking disciplinary action against the accounting firm kmg main hurdman as the result of a 1985 audit of technical equities corp., an investment firm that filed for bankruptcy last year.     a spokeswoman for the california board of accountancy, which certifies public accountants and firms in the state, said a six-page complaint was filed against the new york-based accounting firm.     "we basically charged that the technical equities audit was not conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards," della bousquet, executive officer for the board, told reuters in a telephone interview.     she said a hearing would probably be held before an administrative law judge within three months. penalties could range from censure to revocation of kmg main hurdman's license to do business in california.     kmg main hurdman merged last week with peat marwick mitchell of new york to become the world's largest accounting firm.     the san francisco office of the firm declined to comment on the board's allegations.     bousquet said the company, among other things, was accused of not properly investigating financial transactions and of issuing a favorable opinion in august 1985 that relied on misrepresentations of technical equities management.     she said the accounting firm, although it knew technical equities had severe cash flow and liquidity problems, was accused of not performing a proper audit of it.     the complaint named four individuals, including two partners and two audit managers.     technical equities, based in san jose, filed for protection under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws in february 1986, listing debts of 69.7 mln dlrs to 1,068 investors.     many of the investors were prominent sports and broadcasting figures.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>japanese economic package seen as major change</TITLE>
<BODY>the economic package unveiled yesterday by the ruling liberal democratic party (ldp) marks the start of a major shift away from the policies of the past, private economists and government officials said.     "a big step forward has been taken," said industrial bank of japan ltd senior economist susumu taketomi.     the package, seen as a response to mounting overseas pressure to boost the sagging japanese economy, calls for a supplementary budget of more than 5,000 billion yen later this year, plus increased imports.     although the measures must still gain the approval of the finance ministry, economists said the government will find it too difficult to alter the measures significantly once they have gained domestic and overseas backing.     "at last, the ldp and the ministry of finance are turning a corner," said sumitomo bank ltd's chief economist masahiko koido.     for the past five years the government has adhered to a tight fiscal policy in its drive to stop issuing deficit financing bonds in 1990.     to meet that goal, spending departments are required to submit annual budgets for current expenditure 10 pct below the previous year and investment five pct below.     masayoshi ito, chairman of the ldp's policy affairs council, said yesterday the government must stick to its 1990 fiscal reform target, but should review the ceiling it places on public works spending.     even some finance ministry officials privately acknowledge that policy changes might be needed, including easing the government's iron grip on spending.     economists said the government could meet its 1990 target and also increase spending by using money it got from the sale of nippon telegraph and telephone corp shares and by taking advantage of lower than expected interest rates on its debt. officially, the finance ministry is adhering to its tight stance but some signs of change have appeared.     "we do not have any intention of abandoning our objective to restore fiscal balance," a finance ministry spokesman said.     he said so far the ministry had tried to achieve two goals simultaneously. these were reforming the government's fiscal position and stimulating domestic demand.     but the finance ministry spokesman added, "in looking at the current situation of the economy and the relationship between japan and the united states, we feel we have to place more emphasis on stimulating demand."     economists predict battles within the government over the coming months as the finance ministry fights to ensure the cracks in its policy do not lead to a complete breakdown of fiscal discipline.     "the ministry is afraid that once there is a small hole in the dike, it will lead to a flood," industrial bank's taketomi said.     but taketomi said the ministry, provided it has a device in place to check excess spending for political reasons, is likely to give the go-ahead to a shift in policy.     "this seems to mark the first step toward a more active fiscal policy in response to requests from the international community," he said.     sumitomo's koido said if the government quickly implements the ldp's 5,000 billion yen package, economic growth in the 1987/88 year ending next march 31 could be around three pct, his current forecast of 2.2 pct growth assumes a supplementary budget of around 1,000 billion yen.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>asian exporters fear damage from u.s.-japan rift</TITLE>
<BODY>mounting trade friction between the u.s. and japan has raised fears among many of asia's exporting nations that the row could inflict far-reaching economic damage, businessmen and officials said.     they told reuter correspondents in asian capitals a u.s. move against japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the u.s. and lead to curbs on american imports of their products.     but some exporters said that while the conflict would hurt them in the long-run, in the short-term tokyo's loss might be their gain.     the u.s. has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on imports of japanese electronics goods on april 17, in retaliation for japan's alleged failure to stick to a pact not to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost.     unofficial japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs at 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms said they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the new taxes.     "we wouldn't be able to do business," said a spokesman for leading japanese electronics firm matsushita electric industrial co ltd mc.t,.     "if the tariffs remain in place for any length of time beyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion of exports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the u.s.," said tom murtha, a stock analyst at the tokyo office of broker james capel and co>.     in taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried.     "we are aware of the seriousness of the u.s. threat against japan because it serves as a warning to us," said a senior taiwanese trade official who asked not to be named.     taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs last year, 95 pct of it with the u.s.     the surplus helped swell taiwan's foreign exchange reserves to 53 billion dlrs, among the world's largest.     "we must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers and cut import tariffs to allow imports of u.s. products, if we want to defuse problems from possible u.s. retaliation," said paul sheen, chairman of textile exporters taiwan safe group>.     a senior official of south korea's trade promotion association said the trade dispute between the u.s. and japan might also lead to pressure on south korea, whose chief exports are similar to those of japan.     last year south korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billion dlrs with the u.s., up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.     in malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said tough curbs against japan might allow hard-hit producers of semiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the u.s.     in hong kong, where newspapers have alleged japan has been selling below-cost semiconductors, some electronics manufacturers share that view. but other businessmen said such a short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by further u.s. pressure to block imports.     "that is a very short-term view," said lawrence mills, director-general of the federation of hong kong industry.     "if the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will be extended to other sources. much more serious for hong kong is the disadvantage of action restraining trade," he said.     the u.s. last year was hong kong's biggest export market, accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports.     the australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade talks between the u.s. and japan with interest and concern, industry minister john button said in canberra last friday.     "this kind of deterioration in trade relations between two countries which are major trading partners of ours is a very serious matter," button said.     he said australia's concerns centred on coal and beef, australia's two largest exports to japan and also significant u.s. exports to that country.     meanwhile u.s.-japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the trade stand-off continue.     japan's ruling liberal democratic party yesterday outlined a package of economic measures to boost the japanese economy.     the measures proposed include a large supplementary budget and record public works spending in the first half of the financial year.     they also call for stepped-up spending as an emergency measure to stimulate the economy despite prime minister yasuhiro nakasone's avowed fiscal reform program.     deputy u.s. trade representative michael smith and makoto kuroda, japan's deputy minister of international trade and industry (miti), are due to meet in washington this week in an effort to end the dispute.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>south korea studies restructuring financial sector</TITLE>
<BODY>deputy prime minister kim mahn-je said south korea is studying various measures to reform what he described as its underdeveloped bank and financial sector.     kim, who is also economic planning minister, told a news conference the country's banks and finance houses had not developed to keep pace with their industrial counterparts.     he said two major factors had hampered the development of the financial sector -- high inflation and heavy government intervention in bank decision-making.     he said in the past the government had pressed banks to give soft loans to industry to boost economic growth.     kim said the government would now give top priority to interest rate liberalisation. this could be achieved within several years, though not within one year.     he said liberalisation was possible because south korea's current account had turned from a deficit to a surplus, which had brought in foreign funds and increased domestic savings.     the current account recorded a surplus of 4.65 billion dlrs in 1986 after a deficit of 890 mln dlrs in 1985.     but kim said the government needed to reorganise much of the financial sector.     kim said mergers of some financial companies and the upgrading of others to merchant banks or full banks were being considered by the financial development committee of the finance ministry. he did not elaborate but said he expected no drastic measures to be announced this year.     on liberalisation of the country's stock market, kim said despite seoul's determination to open it up, free investments there by foreigners would not be allowed in the near future because the market was currently "over-heated." he said this was due to ample liquidity created partly by the country's current account surplus.     kim said the market was extremely vulnerable to a sudden influx of foreign funds because it was still very small in terms of size and numbers of shareholders.     "opening up the capital market must wait until the vulnerability to such an influx is removed," he said.     he said only about one mln south koreans, out of a population of 40 mln, invest in the seoul market.  reuter </BODY>

"fierce fighting has been raging since dawn today and all morning where our forces succeeded in dislodging the iranians from all the positions they gained at the muthanna front and the situation ended in iraq's favour," the communique said.     it said iraqi forces were continuing counter-attacks to drive the iranians from the few positions they were still holding on the front of the mohammed al-qassem forces.     the precise locations of the three fronts were not given. a previous iranian offensive launched in january towards basra, iraq's second city, was halted with baghdad saying the iranians had gained only a narrow strip of iraqi territory.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>japan is attempting to cut back semiconductor production to forstall the 300 mln dlrs in u.s. tariffs on japanese electronic goods set to take effect april 17, industry analysts said.     the move is likely to create a sharp price rise and a possible shortage of the key computer components in the next few weeks, the analysts said.     "prices have gone up for memory components, the mainstay of the japanese semiconductor industry," analyst drew peck of donaldson lufkin and jenrette said.     but analysts said the price rises have been slight so far, and some questioned whether japan would be successful in forcing japanese companies to cut production in the long run.     others, however, were more optimistic, saying evidence was already in hand that japan has cut back prodution and halted sales to the grey market, the third country brokers that sell chips at below production costs.     "we've seen the grey market begin to dry up for d-rams, and it has virtually dried up for eproms," said merrill lynch analyst thomas kurlack of the two key memory chips used in computers.     "prices are inching up and lead times on deliveries are stretching," kurlack added.     industry analysts said japan's ministry of international trade and industry, or miti, had requested the cut backs in production to meet the terms of last year's semiconductor accord with the u.s.     the reagan adminsitration recently proposed tariffs on japanese electronic goods, alleging that japan had failed to live up to the accord and continued to dump the computer components in the u.s. market.     but some analysts said japan's attempt to mollify the u.s. was a double edged sword, and might be read at a subtle form of trade retaliation for the tariffs proposed by the u.s.     as production in japan is cut, these analysts argue, prices will rise in the u.s. and few american semiconductor manufactures will be able to take up the slack since most long ago exited the market for memory chips. u.s. computer makers that use the chips in their machines will then be pressured.     "the japanese are looking for ways to reduce trade pressures from washington, but at the same time they're demonstating their muscle," analyst peck said.     the cut backs in japanese production are expected to benefit u.s. chip makers.     "i think this could be a very important factor for u.s. semiconductor manufacturers," industry analyst elliot levine of ladenburg thalmann co said.     but analyst peck said, "it will take a few weeks to see whether japan has genuinely cut production."     he said japanese manufactures were likely to view miti's request unfavorably because chip capacity was still high and production cut backs would lead to significant write-offs in plant and equipment.   reuter </BODY>

<BODY>allegheny international inc, which has agreed to a merge with a jointly-formed first boston inc affiliate in a deal worth 500 mn dlrs, said shareholders of its preferred stock have filed a class action complaint against the company.     the complaint alleges, among other things, that the company and its board agreed to pay first boston an illegal seven mln dlr topping fee if it received a higher offer for the company prior to the buyout.     the suit contends that this fee hampers allegheny's ability to attract other offers or take other actions that would benefit holders of preferred stock. the complaint also alleges federal securities laws violations and breach of fiduciary duty.     the suit requests an injunction against proceeding with the pending offer being made by sunter acquisition to acquire allegheny. sunter acquisition corp and sunter holdings corp were formed by first boston and allegheny.     allegheny said it and the sunter concerns intend to vigorously defend the complaint's charges.     the complaints were filed by robert moss and other parties who are believed to own about 230,000 shares of allegheny's preferred stock.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>australian foreign ship ban ends but nsw ports hit</TITLE>
<BODY>tug crews in new south wales (nsw), victoria and western australia yesterday lifted their ban on foreign-flag ships carrying containers but nsw ports are still being disrupted by a separate dispute, shipping sources said.     the ban, imposed a week ago over a pay claim, had prevented the movement in or out of port of nearly 20 vessels, they said.     the pay dispute went before a hearing of the arbitration commission today.     meanwhile, disruption began today to cargo handling in the ports of sydney, newcastle and port kembla, they said.     the industrial action at the nsw ports is part of the week of action called by the nsw trades and labour council to protest changes to the state's workers' compensation laws.     the shipping sources said the various port unions appear to be taking it in turn to work for a short time at the start of each shift and then to walk off.     cargo handling in the ports has been disrupted, with container movements most affected, but has not stopped altogether, they said.     they said they could not say how long the disruption will go on and what effect it will have on shipping movements.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>bundesbank allocates 6.1 billion marks in tender</TITLE>
<BODY>the bundesbank accepted bids for 6.1 billion marks at today's tender for a 28-day securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank spokesman said.     banks, which bid for a total 12.2 billion marks liquidity, will be credited with the funds allocated today and must buy back securities pledged on may 6.     some 14.9 billion marks will drain from the market today as an earlier pact expires, so the bundesbank is effectively withdrawing a net 8.1 billion marks from the market with today's allocation.     a bundesbank spokesman said in answer to enquiries that the withdrawal of funds did not reflect a tightening of credit policy, but was to be seen in the context of plentiful liquidity in the banking system.     banks held an average 59.3 billion marks at the bundesbank over the first six days of the month, well clear of the likely april minimum reserve requirement of 51 billion marks.     the bundesbank spokesman noted that by bidding only 12.2 billion marks, below the outgoing 14.9 billion, banks themselves had shown they felt they had plenty of liquidity.     dealers said the bundesbank is keen to prevent too much liquidity accruing in the market, as that would blunt the effectiveness of the security repurchase agreement, its main open-market instrument for steering market interest rates. two further pacts are likely this month over the next two weeks.     the bundesbank is currently steering call money between 3.6 and 3.8 pct, although short-term fluctuations outside that range are possible, dealers said.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>dutch propose strict insider trading law</TITLE>

<TITLE>liffe, after record volumes, sees more growth</TITLE>
<BODY>the records in turnover set by the london international financial futures exchange (liffe) in march could be surpassed in the coming months, liffe chief executive michael jenkins said.     last month, liffe saw record monthly futures volume at 1.15 mln lots, and record monthly options volume at 97,700. total liffe volume in first quarter 1987 rose to 2.8 mln contracts, or 89 pct up on the same 1986 period.     long gilt turnover in first quarter 1987 was 300 pct up on the year-ago period at 1.63 mln lots versus 409,500. but t-bond volume fell by 38 pct to 244,500 in first three months 1987.     jenkins told reuters the higher volumes for gilts reflected in part the volatility in the u.k. markets in recent months, while the falloff in t-bonds was an indication of the relative stability of u.s. credit markets.     jenkins said he saw room for the whole financial futures sector to grow further in the coming months. in particular, ft- se 100 futures had great scope for expansion, and turnover in them should be much higher by end 1987.     ft-se futures volume was 62,700 in first quarter 1987, an increase of 124 pct over the 28,000 contracts recorded in the same months of 1986.     institutions here had been slow to find out about the use of stock exchange futures, but they would now learn more, jenkins predicted.     commenting on the difference in popularity between gilts and bonds, jenkins said liffe had designed the widest possible variety of contracts so that at any given time, at least one sector would be volatile enough to attract trading. the current situation of u.s. markets being steady, and u.k. ones changeable, might alter completely in coming months.     a further boost to liffe's volume and attractiveness should come with the introduction of yen bond futures, he added.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>supplies, mideast tension fuel gains in oil</TITLE>
<BODY>petroleum futures rallied today in a market that was expecting declines in domestic supplies and became further unsettled by escalated mideast fighting.     crude oil, gasoline and heating oil all posted gains on the new york mercantile exchange, with crude oil prices matching life-of-contract highs. crude for delivery in may closed 17 cents higher at 18.84 dlrs a barrel.     "crude futures could jump above 19 dlrs a barrel but will not remain there long if products are not strong," robert murphy, account executive at e.f. hutton, said.     traders said prices were supported by anticipation that the american petroleum institute would report a decline in domestic inventories of petroleum products in a weekly report.     traders said prices also were supported by an escalation in the iran-iraq war, with the iranians reportedly launching a new offensive against iraqi positions, and iraq attacking offshore oil fields and an oil export depot.     buying by speculators continued to prompt gains in gold and silver futures on the commodity exchange in new york.     gold prices retreated at midday, but rallied before the close with support from the silver market, which was approaching two-year highs, traders said.     soybean futures posted strong gains on the chicago board of trade, while corn and wheat were mostly higher.     traders said cash sales have been slow in the country, and the soybean harvest in brazil has been delayed by rain, which is limiting supplies.     in addition, the agriculture department last week projected a substantial drop in soybean acreage this year.     monday's report that the usda inspected 46 mln bushels of corn for export last week was unexpectedly high and, coupled with a lack of farm sales, provided support for the corn market, traders said.     live hogs and frozen pork bellies rallied on the chicago mercantile exchange, while cattle ended lower.     live hogs pushed ahead on a lack of supplies because many farmers are turning their attention to spring planting rather than marketing livestock, traders said, noting that cash sales have been lighter than expected this week.     the lack of marketing also has supported pork bellies, but prices drifted lower for moderate losses in nearby months as speculators sold contracts to take profits, traders said.     cattle prices closed lower but continued to show strength related to tight supplies.     prices pushed ahead to new contract highs, extending gains past three-year peaks set monday, as tight supplies forced meat packers to bid aggressively for available animals.     however, some traders sold contracts to take profits after the extended rally, which has seen the april delivery contract soar to 69.90 cents a pound from 56 cents a pound at the start of the year.     new york coffee futures closed higher on trade talk brazil would not be an aggressive seller near term, analysts said.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>u.s. trade reprepresentative clayton yeutter said that if congress were to require trade retaliation, it would only close markets and would result in less trade.     many congressional proposals do not appear to be overtly protectionist, yet their undeniable effect would be to close off market opportunitites, just as exchange rate movement is unleashing such opportunities for the first time in several years, he said in remarks prepared for an address to members of the university of chicago's graduate school of business.     chicago - the rally in soybean prices may prompt farmers to plant more soybean acres than the usda projected in last week's acreage report, especially if new crop futures stay above the psychologically important 5.00 dlr a bushel mark, traders and analysts said.     new york - magma copper co, a subsidiary of newmont mining corp, said it is lowering its copper cathode price by 0.50 cent to 65.50 cents a lb, effective immediately.     london - brazil is likely to adopt a conservative coffee sales policy given the absence of international coffee organization export quotas, at least until october this year, according to the latest monthly coffee report from london trade house e.d. and f. man.     london - delegates to this week's quarterly session of the international tin council expect indonesia to vote for an extension of the sixth international tin agreement.     havana - cuban president fidel castro told a congress of the union of young communists here that the production of crude sugar during the harvest still in progress is 800,000 tonnes behind schedule.     in a speech sunday, published in today's official paper granma, castro said unseasonable rains since january seriously interrupted harvesting and milling operations, especially in the central and western parts of the island.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>nickel prices unlikely to rise much - shearson</TITLE>
<BODY>nickel prices are unlikely to rise significantly from current levels unless further steps are taken to reduce production, shearson lehman brothers said in its quarterly nickel market report.     the market had recovered slightly to around 1.72 dlrs a lb yesterday from its four year low of 1.55 dlrs in early january, due to the absence of soviet nickel cathode deliveries, but shearson sees soviet shipments soon returning to last year's buoyant levels, which should ease current tightness.     output reductions by producers will take effect later this year but are likely to be offset by increases elsewhere.     shearson said the nickel market will be virtually in balance during 1987, with total non-socialist world demand at 556,000 tonnes, compared with an estimated 544,000 tonnes in 1986, production at 505,000 tonnes (504,000) and imports from socialist countries at 47,000 tonnes (50,000).     it forecast prices will edge higher during the year from a first quarter average of 1.67 dlrs a lb up to 1.77 dlrs in the last quarter. the year's average will be around 1.72 dlrs a lb compared with 1.76 dlrs in 1986, using london metal exchange cash metal prices in dollar terms and assuming an average 1987 sterling exchange rate of 1.55 dlrs.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>bond corp still considering atlas mining bail-out</TITLE>
<BODY>bond corp holdings ltd bona.s, and atlas consolidated mining and development corp atlc.mn> are still holding talks on a bail-out package for the troubled mining firm, an atlas statement said.     atlas, the philippines' biggest copper producer, said it had been hit by depressed world copper prices. it reported a net loss of 976.38 mln pesos in the year ending december 1986, compared with a net loss of 1.53 billion in 1985.     the company said it had been able to cut its losses because its scaled-down copper operations in the central island of cebu started in the second half of 1986.     atlas said negotiations were continuing on the acquisition by bond of the company's existing bank loans and their restructuring into a gold loan.     a memorandum of understanding signed by the two sides in october last year said bond would acquire atlas' total loans of 275 mln dlrs, to be repaid by the mining company in gold.     atlas said the two sides were also discussing equity infusion into atlas and the creation of a development fund for further exploration and development of the company's gold properties in the central province of masbate.     wilson banks, general manager of bond corp international ltd> in hong kong, told reuters the atlas statement on the negotiations was "reasonably accurate."     banks said bond corp was seriously considering several investments in the philippines but did not give details.     in its statement, atlas said development of the pre-world war two underground mines in masbate had been accelerated and the ore tonnage had increased, extending the operation's life at least until 1993.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>south korea moves to slow growth of trade surplus</TITLE>
<BODY>south korea's trade surplus is growing too fast and the government has started taking steps to slow it down, deputy prime minister kim mahn-je said.     he told a press conference the government planned to increase investment, speed up the opening of the local market to foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to hold the surplus "at a proper level."     but he said the government would not allow the won to appreciate too much in a short period of time. south korea has been under pressure from washington to revalue the won.     the u.s. wants south korea to cut its trade surplus with the u.s., which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3 billion dlrs in 1985.     kim, who is also economic planning minister, said prospects were bright for the south korean economy, but the government would try to hold the current account surplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next five years.     "our government projections of eight pct gnp growth, five billion dlrs of (current account) surplus and 12 pct growth in exports all seemed to be reasonable early this year. but now the surplus is growing faster than we expected," he said.     trade ministry officials said south korea's exports rose 35 pct to 9.34 billion dlrs in the first three months of this year, while imports rose only 8.5 pct to 8.2 billion dlrs.     kim said the swing of south korea's current account to a surplus of 4.65 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlr deficit in 1985 was very significant. the surplus enabled the country to reduce its foreign debt last year for the first time.     south korea's foreign debt, which fell to 44.5 billion dlrs in 1986 from 46.8 billion in 1985, is still among the largest in asia.     "this huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of the major constraints on our development... last year was a major turning point for the korean economy," kim said.     kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio of foreign debt to the country's gnp to about 20 pct in 1991, from about 50 pct in 1986.     "the government, however, does not want to accelerate reducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus," he said.     kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflation and lead to trade friction with seoul's major trading partners, particularly the united states.     "we need a surplus because we have to reduce our debt, but we are taking measures to hold the size of the surplus at a proper level," kim said.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>u.s. credit markets mixed at midsession</TITLE>
<BODY>u.s. credit markets were mixed in dull trading at midsession, with moderate losses in coupon issues and treasury bill rates near unchanged.     bills improved slightly on remarks from federal reserve chairman paul volcker that a restrictive monetary policy would be damaging to investment and that last week's increases in u.s. banks' prime lending rates to 7.75 pct from 7.50 pct was not connected with fed policy, dealers said.      coupon issues were 1/32 to 5/16 lower, pressured by a weak dollar. treasury bill rates were anywhere from three basis points lower to one basis point higher.     the key 7-1/2 pct treasury bond was 5/16 lower at 95-26/32 to yield 7.87 pct compared with 7.84 pct at yesterday's close.     dealers said remarks from federal reserve chairman paul volcker indicating that exchange rates had adjusted enough to narrow the u.s. trade deficit and warning that a further, sizable dollar fall could be counterproductive had little exchange rate impact as they were seen as a reiteration of his views.     in any case, they said the dollar is expected to be under pressure while monetary officials of leading industrial nations meet this week in washington, which may hurt bonds.     dealers said three-month bill rates had eased early in the session on a few sizable buy orders from retail accounts, but that otherwise there was little activity in this sector.     "when volcker hit the tape it helped bills, because it makes people think the fed is not going to tighten," a bill trader said. "but it's a nervous trade, with no real buyers."     three-month bills were bid at 5.50 pct, three basis points below their price at yesterday's auction, while six-month bills rose one basis point from their auction price to 5.64 pct bid.     year bills rose one basis points to 5.74 pct bid.     most economists expected the federal reserve to supply temporary reserves, but most had forecasted an indirect injection via customer repurchase agreements rather than a direct injection via two-day system repurchases which the fed conducted at its usual intervention time.     the fed intervened when federal funds were trading at 6-1/8 pct. funds opened at this level and remained there at midday, down from yesterday's 6.20 pct avearge.     the 6-3/8 pct two-year notes fell 1/32 to 99-21/32 at midday and the 7-1/4 pct 10-years dropped 9/32 to 97-27/32.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>negotiations between mining companies and the national union of mineworkers are foundering and mines could face a may day work stoppage, the chamber of mines said.     it said the union had called off talks on a specific issue, the introduction of a labour day on may 1.     the union refused a request to give advance notification of the names of workers who would be working on may 1 rather than taking the option of a paid holiday, the chamber said.     it said mining companies wanted advance notice in order to plan their operations.     "the union is adamant only employees who wish to work on labour day should notify management," the chamber said.     "this raises the prospect that the mines will once again face stay-away action on may 1 and that the employees who do not work will once again forfeit pay."     it said the union accepted all the proposals except giving advance notification for may 1.     it said miners had been offered a full paid holiday on may 1 or a premium of six pct of their basic monthly pay for working that day.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>japan ministry says open farm trade would hit u.s.</TITLE>
<BODY>japan's agriculture ministry, angered by u.s. demands that japan open its farm products market, will tell u.s. officials at talks later this month that liberalisation would harm existing u.s. farm exports to japan, a senior ministry official said.     "imports from the u.s. would drop due to active sales drives by other suppliers," the official, who declined to be named, said. "japan is the largest customer for u.s. farm products and it is not reasonable for the u.s. to demand japan liberalise its farm import market," he said.     agriculture minister mutsuki kato has said if the u.s. insists japan open its protected rice market it will also open its wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated to protect local farmers.     australia and canada could then increase their wheat exports as they are more competitive than the u.s., he said. end-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.     u.s. agriculture secretary richard lyng, who is due to visit japan for talks between april 16-27, has said he will ask japan to offer a share of its rice market to u.s. suppliers and remove quotas on u.s. beef and citrus imports.     other countries are already cutting into the u.s. market share here. australia, the largest beef supplier to japan, has been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year beef accord next march 31.     imports of u.s. corn have fallen due to increased sales from china and south america, while japanese soybean imports from brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although the u.s. will remain the largest supplier.     u.s. feedgrain sales will also drop if japan opens up its beef imports, since japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain imports, mainly from the u.s., japanese officials said.     an indication of the u.s. position came last december when under secretary of agriculture daniel amstutz said japan has the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to u.s. agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing some one billion dlrs in new business.     the u.s. has also asked the general agreement on tariffs and trade to investigate the legality of japanese import controls on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices, purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts, prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.     to help calm heated trade relations with the u.s., japan's top business group keidanren has urged the government to remove residual import restrictions on agricultural products.     but agriculture minister kato has ruled out any emotional reaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issue should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the industrial sector.     "japan is the largest buyer of u.s. farm products, and these issues should not be discussed on the same table," the official said.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>indonesian commodity exchange may expand</TITLE>
<BODY>the indonesian commodity exchange is likely to start trading in at least one new commodity, and possibly two, during calendar 1987, exchange chairman paian nainggolan said.     he told reuters in a telephone interview that trading in palm oil, sawn timber, pepper or tobacco was being considered.     trading in either crude palm oil (cpo) or refined palm oil may also be introduced. but he said the question was still being considered by trade minister rachmat saleh and no decision on when to go ahead had been made.     the fledgling exchange currently trades coffee and rubber physicals on an open outcry system four days a week.     "several factors make us move cautiously," nainggolan said. "we want to move slowly and safely so that we do not make a mistake and undermine confidence in the exchange."     physical rubber trading was launched in 1985, with coffee added in january 1986. rubber contracts are traded fob, up to five months forward. robusta coffee grades four and five are traded for prompt delivery and up to five months forward, exchange officials said.     the trade ministry and exchange board are considering the introduction of futures trading later for rubber, but one official said a feasibility study was needed first. no decisions are likely until after indonesia's elections on april 23, traders said.     trade minister saleh said on monday that indonesia, as the world's second largest producer of natural rubber, should expand its rubber marketing effort and he hoped development of the exchange would help this.     nainggolan said that the exchange was trying to boost overseas interest by building up contacts with end-users.     he said teams had already been to south korea and taiwan to encourage direct use of the exchange, while a delegation would also visit europe, mexico and some latin american states to encourage participation.     officials say the infant exchange has made a good start although trading in coffee has been disappointing.     transactions in rubber between the start of trading in april 1985 and december 1986 totalled 9,595 tonnes, worth 6.9 mln dlrs fob, plus 184.3 mln rupiah for rubber delivered locally, the latest exchange report said.      trading in coffee in calendar 1986 amounted to only 1,905 tonnes in 381 lots, valued at 6.87 billion rupiah.      total membership of the exchange is now nine brokers and 44 traders.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>sumitomo bank aims at quick recovery from merger</TITLE>
<BODY>sumitomo bank ltd sumi.t, is certain to lose its status as japan's most profitable bank as a result of its merger with the heiwa sogo bank, financial analysts said.     osaka-based sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9 trillion yen, merged with heiwa sogo, a small, struggling bank with an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, in october.     but despite the link-up, sumitomo president koh komatsu told reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain its position.     "we'll be back in position in first place within three years," komatsu said in an interview.     he said that while the merger will initially reduce sumitomo's profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expand sumitomo's branch network in the tokyo metropolitan area where it has been relatively weak.     but financial analysts are divided on whether and how quickly the gamble will pay off.     some said sumitomo may have paid too much for heiwa sogo in view of the smaller bank's large debts. others argue the merger was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch network from scratch.     the analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. it has expanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business and geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the wisdom of some of those moves.     "they've made bold moves to put everything in place. now it's largely out of their hands," said kleinwort benson ltd financial analyst simon smithson.     among sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move to enter u.s. securities business by taking a share in american investment bank goldman, sachs and co.     sumitomo last august agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5 pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at least, the federal reserve board has forbidden them to exchange personnel, or increase the business they do with each other.     "the tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the fed was stricter than sumitomo expected," said one analyst.     but komatsu said the move will pay off in time.     "u.s. regulations will change in the near future and if so, we can do various things. we only have to wait two or three years, not until the 21st century," komatsu said.     komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes into the securities business at home.     article 65 of the securities and exchange act, japan's version of the u.s. glass-steagall act, separates commercial from investment banking.     but the walls between the two are crumbling and komatsu said he hopes further deregulation will create new opportunities.     "we need to find new business chances," komatsu said. "in some cases these will be securities related, in some cases trust bank related. that's the kind of deregulation we want."     until such changes occur, sumitomo will focus on such domestic securities business as profitable government bond dealing and strengthening relations with meiko securities co ltd, in which it holds a five pct share, komatsu said.     he said sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering the securities business here through its swiss universal bank subsidiary, banca del gottardo.      the finance ministry is expected to grant licences to securities subsidiaries of u.s. commercial banks soon, following a similar decision for subsidiaries of european universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.     but komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar decision on a gottardo subsidiary.     "we don't want to make waves. we expect this will be allowed in two or three years," he said.     like other city banks, sumitomo is also pushing to expand lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to replace disappearing demand from big business, he added.     the analysts said sumitomo will have to devote a lot of time to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the merger with ailing heiwa sogo.     "it's (sumitomo) been bold in its strategies," said kleinwort's smithson.     "after that, it's a question of absorbing and juggling around. it will be the next decade before we see if the strategy is right or wrong."  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>italian bank deposit guarantee fund approved</TITLE>
<BODY>the executive committee of the italian national banking association (abi), representing the country's major credit institutions, approved the setting up of a common reserve fund to guarantee customer deposits in the event of bank failures.     abi chairman giannino parravicini told a news conference that the fund would not be operative until the latter part of 1987, and only on condition that 60 pct of banks representing at least 75 pct of total deposits participated.     he said the fund would initially have 1,000 billion lire available and would cover deposits of up to three billion lire.     a statute for establishing a deposit guarantee fund has already been approved by the bank of italy and by an interministerial committee on credit and savings.     the 1,000 billion lire initial funding, which will be provided through contributions from banks which opt to join the scheme, compares with an originally targetted figure of 4,000 billion lire.     parravicini said the fund would be gradually increased to 4,000 billion lire by end 1991, and that the decision to achieve this figure gradually rather than immediately was due to fiscal considerations.     the fund, still to be formally ratified by abi's steering committee, will provide 100 pct coverage on deposits of up to 200 mln lire, 90 pct on deposits between 200 mln and one billion lire and 80 pct on those between one billion and three billion lire.     assuming that all banks join the fund, contributions would be equivalent to around 0.25 pt of a bank's total deposits.     the abi's steering committee later unanimously ratified the executive committee's decision to create the common reserve fund.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>japan will seek to strengthen the paris accord on currency stability at the meeting of the group of seven leading industrial nations tomorrow, japanese officials said.     however, the officials travelling with japanese finance minister kiichi miyazawa and who asked not to be identified, would not provide any details of how they wanted the accord, which was signed by the six leading industrial democracies in february, to be strengthened.     currency target zones, or reference ranges, will not be discussed at the g-7 meeting which is scheduled for tomorrow, the japanese officials said.     the meeting, which is being held in conjunction with this week's international monetary fund/world bank sessions, will reaffirm the currency pact and there is no need for changing  the language used in the paris accord, the officials said.     miyazawa met with u.s. treasury secretary james baker early in this afternoon and discussed the dollar/yen exchange rates, officials said, but they declined to disclosed the details of that discussion.     the japanese officials also declined to detail what miyazawa and baker discussed on the subject of greater joint intervention in currency markets to stabilize the dollar or on independent american intervention.     the officials said such a money market action to stabilize the dollar is not only for the benefit of japan, which is suffering from a sharp appreciation in its currency, but also for the benefit of the united states as well.     as to u.s. urgings for japan to take steps to boost its domestic demand to reduce its trade surplus, japan will explain economic measures to the g-7, the officials said.     however, miyazawa failed to outline the size of the japanese economic package in his meeting with baker today because the japanese 1987/88 budget has not been authorized by the diet, or parliament, despite the new fiscal year which started april one, the officials said.     japan's ruling liberal democratic party revealed its own economic package today calling for more than 5,000 billion yen in additional spending.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>finns and canadians to study mtbe production plant</TITLE>
<BODY>finland's national oil company neste oy neoy.he, said in a statement it had agreed with canadian firms to study the feasibility of building a plant in edmonton, canada, to produce a replacement for lead in petrol.     the prospective plant would cost an estimated 270 mln canadian dlrs and would produce methyl tertiary butyl ether (mtbe) from raw materials available locally, it said.     the partners in the study are neste oy, celanese canada inc, hoechst celanese corporation and trade mountain pipe line company ltd, of vancouver, b.c.     the edmonton site was suitable because of the raw materials availability, the proximity to pipeline transportation and the important capital and operating advantages gained by locating on an existing celanese canada site, the statement said.     the partners would look into the feasibility of a plant producing 500,000 tonnes per annum of mtbe, an octane enhancer that can replace tetra ethyl lead.     most of the mtbe would be targeted for the united states where lead levels in gasoline are being lowered because of health concerns, the statement added.     canadian lead limits are currently 11 times as high as the u.s. limit but lead is scheduled for virtual elimination in canada by 1993, which should create a canadian demand for mtbe, it said.     finland's neste oy, whose turnover last year was over five billion dlrs, has extensive experience with mtbe. it has a major investment in an mtbe plant in saudi arabia.     the edmonton, alberta plant would be scheduled to go on stream in late 1989, the statement said.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>yeutter warns congress on trade retaliation</TITLE>
<BODY>u.s. trade representative clayton yeutter said that if congress were to require trade retaliation, it would only close markets and would result in less trade.     in remarks prepared for an address to members of the university of chicago's graduate school of business, yeutter said many congressional proposals do not appear to be overtly protectionist, yet their undeniable effect would be to close off market opportunitites, just as exchange rate movement is unleashing such opportunities for the first time in several years.     "despite all our progress on trade policy and despite the president's comprehensive competitiveness initiative, there are many in congress who still are supporting trade bills containing many dangerous provisions," yuetter said.     yeutter said many countries would prefer u.s. retaliation to opening their own markets. "we should be intelligent enough to not let them off the hook that easily," he said.     he said that tough but flexible legislative language is infinitely preferable to tough but inflexible language.     both house and senate trade proposals place undesirable limits on presidential discretion, he said.     "limiting the president's ability to consider all available options on issues as sensitive as these would be most unwise," yeutter said. "that could readily provoke retaliation, which would unneccesarily embroil us in trade wars, injuring most competitive export industries."     yeutter said present u.s. trade laws are fundamentally sound.     president reagan has threatened or implemented retaliation eight times in the last 18 months -- most recently in the case of japanese semiconductors being dumped in world markets.     "he took these steps as a last resort, only after carefully analyzing all the contingencies on a case by case basis and only after determining that such actions would open markets to american exports", he said.     yeutter said it would be foolish to attempt to solve the u.s. trade deficit by focusing on trade policy alone. he added that the trade deficit was created primarily by macroeconomic policy shortcomings here and abroad.  reuter </BODY>

"i have nothing in my briefcase except an explanation of the current situation," kuroda told the daily newspaper asahi shimbun.     kuroda said the u.s. decision was based on incorrect data and an exaggerated sense of miti's power to control market forces. "the u.s. has excessive expectations. to stabilise supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time," he said.     kuroda also laid part of the blame for low u.s. chip sales in japan on a lack of effort by american firms here.     he said if he fails in talks tomorrow and friday to forestall sanctions, he will seek further talks with u.s. trade representative clayton yeutter. u.s. officials said this week's talks are unlikely to delay imposition of tariffs.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>malaysia may not meet 1987 oil palm target</TITLE>
<BODY>malaysia is unlikely to meet its targeted output of five mln tonnes of oil palm in calendar 1987, oil palm growers told reuters.     output in 1987 is expected to reach around 4.5 mln tonnes, unchanged from 1986, because of drought, low use of fertiliser and overstressed palms, they said.     the growers were asked for their reaction to an oil world newsletter report that malaysia's oil palm output is likely to drop sharply this year.     palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne, or about 115 ringgit less than soybean oil, but malaysia must sell more palm oil to prevent a stock buildup that could damage the industry, a leading grower told reuters.     the country's palm oil stocks now total some 500,000 tonnes against about 800,000 last march, the growers said.     the growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this year due to pressure from south american and u.s. soybean output.     the current south american oilseed harvest, mainly soybean, is likely to be around 25.7 mln tonnes against the previous 21.7 mln tonne crop, they said.     in addition, new u.s. soybean plantings are also expected to enter the market around november when malaysian palm oil output peaks.     they said new planting of palms is also likely to slow, with some 50,000 hectares expected to be planted with new trees against 100,000 in 1986, although the effects of this reduction will not be felt for about another three years.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>more u.s. grain certificates needed, study says</TITLE>
<BODY>more generic grain certificates should be released onto the market in order for the u.s. certificate program to have its full effect on commodities, according to a study by sparks commodities inc.     the agriculture department should make grain deficiency payments and paid land diversion payments in a two-third certificate, one-third cash ratio through fiscal year 1989,  carroll brunthaver, president of sparks commodities, told a house agriculture subcommittee hearing on certificates.     thereafter, government payments should be issued in roughly a 50-50 split between cash and certificates, brunthaver said.     the sparks study on certificates examined two possible scenarios through the 1990 growing season -- a "zero certificate case," where no certificate program was assumed, and an alternative case labeled "adequate certificate case" in which sufficient certificates would be released so that grain prices would not be artificially supported by market shortages due to acreage reduction programs or government holdings.     the study showed that total grain use under the adequate certificate scenario would exceed the zero certificate scenario by 11.2 pct.     usage would be markedly more in 1989 and 1990, when grain usage under a certificate program was estimated to exceed the zero certificate case by 15 to 19 pct.     for the five-year period examined, government expenditures under the adequate certificate case were 7.0 billion dlrs, or 7.5 pct less than under the zero certificate case.     the sparks study said that 5.1 billion dlrs, or 70 pct of those savings resulted from smaller government storage costs.     the study also estimated that government grain stocks under the adequate certificate case would be 4.7 billion bushels below the zero certificate case at the end of the period examined.     the sparks study said that while certificates permit market prices to fall below loan levels, these lower prices increase commodity usage and reduce the net costs of certificates versus cash.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>dollar ends with modest losses in new york</TITLE>
<BODY>the dollar ended with modest net losses against most major currencies as the market conducted a final round of position-squaring ahead of tomorrow's crucial group of five and group of seven meetings, dealers said.     "the dollar was trendless today. people are waiting to see if anything new comes from the meetings tomorrow and will then take it from there," said one dealer at a top european bank.     as a result, generally supportive comments by federal reserve chairman paul volcker and japanese finance minister kiichi miyazawa went largely unheeded.     the dollar closed at 145.60/70 yen, down from 145.85/90.     however, the dollar's yen closing level was comfortably above its overseas low of just under 145 yen. against the mark, the dollar finished at 1.8270/80 marks after falling to 1.8180 in europe and ending at 1.8260/70 here yesterday.     in congressional testimony this morning, fed chairman paul volcker harped on his long-held fears about the potentially catastrophic fallout from a sharp dollar decline.     he also said the dollar's fall, thus far, should be "large enough, in a context of a growing world economy and fiscal restraint in the u.s., to support widespread expectations of a narrowing in the real trade deficit in the period ahead."     the market impact of volcker's comments was minimal. "it was the same old story. volcker was just fulfilling his role as a defender of the currency," said one trader.     the market was similarly dismissive of japanese finance minister kiichi miyazawa's upbeat appraisal of his hour-long conversation with u.s. treasury secretary james baker this afternoon.     miyazawa said that they both agreed on the need for currency stabilization and that he was satisfied with the role the u.s. has played in coordinated international efforts to prop up the dollar since the late february paris agreement.     "miyazawa can talk until he's blue in the face. the only person who will make a difference is baker," said alan rose of first interstate bank in los angeles.     "the key question for the currency market is whether the (reagan) administration will have a change of view to the dollar. if not, the dollar is going lower," he added.     the dollar's recent tumble to a 40-year low of 144.70 yen was linked to the market's perception that washington was unhappy with the rate of adjustment of world trade imbalances and that a continued orderly dollar decline was the least disruptive way of accelerating the process.     while most analysts do not expect any marked change of attitude in washington, they were reluctant to open any fresh positions until later in the week.     "we are reserving judgement for the time being," said doug madison of commerzbank ag.     the tranquility of the dollar market spread to sterling trading today. the pound ended unchanged against the dollar at 1.6175/85 and edged up to 2.957 marks from 2.955 yesterday.     however, underlying sentiment remains positive after a u.k. opinion poll gave the ruling conservative party its highest popularity rating since it was re-elected in 1983.     "sterling still seems to be on the firm side," said one dealer.     the canadian currency also retained a generally stronger tone, rising to 1.3055/60 to its u.s. counterpart from 1.3080/85 yesterday.     according to figures provided by morgan guaranty trust co, the dollar's trade-weighted value at midday was 5.7 pct below average market rates in 1980-82, compared with 5.5 pct yesterday.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>economic spotlight - kuwaiti economy</TITLE>
<BODY>kuwait's oil-reliant and debt-ridden economy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil prices will determine the pace of recovery, bankers and economists say.     crucial will be the ability of the 13-member opec to hold oil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in the northern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens.     bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of gross domestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last year after contracting 8.1 pct the year before.     this was after taking into account inflation in consumer prices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986.     factors depressing economic activity include the 6-1/2-year-old iran-iraq war on kuwait's doorstep, which threatens the emirate's vital oil export lifeline through the gulf and has sapped business confidence.     but sentiment received a much-needed boost in september when, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisis caused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensive new debt settlement program was introduced.     the share crash, result of a speculative spree in forward trading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default.     the cheques were also used as collateral for consumer spending, thus generating an informal credit system.     much of the debt has been watered down but big sums are still owed by individuals and companies.     there was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs) in outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of which one-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank as bad or doubtful debt. but the government has repeatedly said it will not allow any banks to go under.     the new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of problem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whether debtors have regular cash flows or not.     banks' shareholders and depositors will have their rights guaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance in a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sector is the biggest after oil.     kuwait is better placed than any other opec country to ride out the oil glut, bankers and economists say.     kuwait has an opec quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd) compared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned last year by oil minister sheikh ali al-khalifa al-sabah.     but strategic diversification into downstream operations in europe several years ago and a hefty refining investment at home gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell over one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products.     oil industry sources say kuwait is able to get an average 2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed product such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than as crude.     bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason for cautious optimism. other reasons are low domestic inflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent years and signs government spending on productive sectors will remain steady.     external accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8 billion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct below that for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hit gulf.     kuwait's petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were put officially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment income of the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.     but for the first time since the end of the oil boom, these reserves may not be enough to prevent a "real" budget deficit for the 1986/87 fiscal year ending june 30, bankers say.     in a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary, revenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct, doubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.     this left out income from state reserves, usually excluded in official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers at up to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in some shortfall.     bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast for economic growth this year or next.     "it depends on oil prices," one said. "this summer is important."     cabinet affairs minister rashid al-rashid said last sunday the cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise state spending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate the economy.     he gave no details but bankers say these are expected to be spelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in june.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>texas may consider income tax to solve budget woes</TITLE>
<BODY>the state of texas, faced with a record 5.8 billion dlr budget deficit over the next two years, may have to consider introducing income tax,economic analysts said.      such a possibility was unthinkable a few years back when the state's enormous wealth from oil and gas revenues easily allowed texans the luxury of paying no personal or corporate income tax.      however, last year's dramatic slump in oil prices not only sent the texas economy into a tailspin, but cut heavily into the state's tax revenues.     both moody's investor services and standard and poor's cut their credit ratings of the state to double a from the top triple a in early march.     moody's vice president george w. leung said it was the first time texas' rating had been lowered since 1962, adding the report noted that while "the legislature is now considering proposals to restore budget balance, medium term prospects for full recovery are weak."     with only a slight improvement in the economy seen by state comptroller bob bullock, the texas legislature must grapple with a one billion dlr deficit by august 31 and another 4.8 billion dlr deficit by the end of the next biennium. no other state in u.s. history has faced such a deficit.     "there is a strong independent streak in texans and five years ago i would never have dreamed the state legislature would institute an income tax," said george bland, assistant professor of political science at north texas state university, adding, "now my contacts at the legislature tell me it's coming, it's inevitable, it's only a matter of time."      state taxes on oil and gas production traditionally supplied as much as a third of the state's revenues.     however, that source has fallen to about 15 pct in recent years, and with last year's price slump, the state's dependence on sales taxes is approaching 50 pct.      bland said he believes the tax reform act will be a major factor in the state's decision because under it sales taxes are no longer deductible from federal income tax while state income tax is.     john kennedy, senior research associate at the austin-based texas research league said, "there is a great deal of popular sentiment against it, plus the first plank of governor clements' platform was no tax increases, let alone a new tax."     however, he said that since the oil price fall the state faced a choice of either instituting an income tax or broadening and possibly raising the sales tax.     steve pejovich, director of the center for free enterprise at texas a and m university and an opponent of income taxes, said he favored reforming the present tax system to take account of the changed structure of the economy.     "we should rely less on traditional sources, such as oil and agriculture and real estate and more on service industries, manufacturing and high-tech," pejovich said.     tony proffitt, an aide to state comptroller bob bullock said, "bullock is opposed to an income tax, but has warned the legislature that if they get tired of looking at everything else, that's the only option."     apart from texas, states which have no individual income tax are alaska, florida, nevada, new hampshire, south dakota, washington and wyoming      for the time being, attorney general jim mattox has ruled that the legislature may carry over the current one billion dlr deficit into the next biennium, even though the state consitution requires a balanced budget. but as state treasurer ann richards said last thursday, "jim mattox's decision today turns the heat down on the pressure cooker, but we must not think that the goose isn't still cooking."     opponents to new or higher taxes argue in favor of spending cuts. but the state is already under pressure from a federal district court to clean up its overcrowded prison system -- or face 24 mln dlrs a month in fines.     and u.s. education secretary william bennett has accused the state, among others, of lax education reform. earlier this year, both houses of the legislature, citing financial restraints as well as teacher morale, passed bills abandoning plans to require teachers to take competency tests.     bland said he believes the state will set up a commission next year to "study alternative revenue sources," with an income tax being instituted as early as january 1989.     "if the political leaders are educated about (the effects of the tax reform act), i think there will be a gradual drift toward income tax," he said.                   reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>nippon steel denies china seeking japanese plants</TITLE>
<BODY>nippon steel corp nstc.t, denied local newspaper reports that china has been seeking to buy steel plants from japanese firms which plan to suspend output under the recently announced rationalisation program.     the mainichi shimbun quoted nippon steel as saying that china's state planning commission and some chinese firms have asked japanese makers to sell them steel works and rolling mills to expand steelmaking cheaply. it named no sources.     a nippon steel spokesman told reuters that china has made no such official request, and the company was not considering such sales at the moment.     but mainichi quoted nippon steel officials as saying if prices are reasonable, they would export their used mills to china.     the paper said china's crude steel output totalled 52 mln tonnes in calendar 1986 and that it plans to increase to 80 mln by 1996.     japan's steel industry rationalisation plan is aimed at cutting production capacity sharply over the next few years.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>san miguel deal hit by more lawsuits</TITLE>
<BODY>a bid by san miguel corp (smc) sanm.mn, to buy back 38.1 mln sequestered shares from united coconut planters bank (ucpb) has been hit by two new lawsuits, sources in the philippine food and brewery company said.     a manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring ucpb from selling the shares, which represent 31 pct of smc's outstanding capital stock of 121 mln shares, until hearings on april 21 on a petition filed by eduardo cojuangco, a former chairman of both smc and ucpb.     cojuangco said the coconut industry investment fund (ciif) and 1.4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares.     cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by ucpb and represented a blue chip investment. his petition said ucpb's plans to sell the shares to smc were "a serious breach of fiduciary duties."     the smc sources said the proposed share sale could also be held up by a second derivative suit filed before the securities and exchange commission (sec) by eduardo de los angeles, a government nominee on the company's board.     de los angeles, who represents smc's minority stockholders, asked the sec to block the transaction, approved last week by the company's board.     on april 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of the sequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos per share. de los angeles told the sec the company's retained earnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by the purchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration of dividends.     de los angeles said the share purchase would also violate an smc agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debt to equity ratio. he quoted smc's chief financial director ramon del rosario as telling the board that the transaction would boost the ratio to 2.5-to-1.     in petitioning the sec, de los angeles amended an earlier suit two weeks ago in which he charged smc chairman andres soriano iii and nine other directors of violating their duties.     de los angeles' earlier complaint related to smc assuming last december a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by smc's hong kong subsidiary neptunia corp> for a down payment on the shares. the loan assumption was again ratified by last week's board meeting.     an arbitration panel set up by president corazon aquino to resolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report by april 15.     "the amended suit filed by eduardo de los angeles is part of a continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregard of the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an early disposition of the sequestered shares," san miguel corp said in a statement.     "coming as it does, when san miguel corp and ucpb have reached agreement on the price of the shares and the method of payment, this suit is in direct contravention of the government's expressed desire to reach an amicable settlement of the controversy by april 15," the statement added.     a san miguel spokesman said he had no comment on cojuangco's court petition, adding: "any statement coming from us might be interpreted as adversarial."     meanwhile, ramon diaz, the head of a government panel which sequestered the shares last year, said soriano was not eligible to buy the major portion of the shares because he was a united states citizen.     the sequestered shares are split into 24 mln "a" shares, which can only be owned by filipinos, and 14 mln "b" shares which are available to foreign buyers.     smc sources said soriano personally was not among prospective buyers. they said the shares would be purchased by the a.soriano> group of companies, smc, neptunia and unnamed institutional investors. soriano was named as one of the buyers in a bid in march 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by ucpb.     the sale was aborted when diaz's presidential commission on good government sequestered the shares on suspicion they were owned by cojuangco, a close associate of former president ferdinand marcos. cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in the u.s.. the shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend announced last june.     "we have no objection to soriano buying the "b" shares," diaz told reuters. "but everything is on hold now."     the smc spokesman said he did not know if the controversy would be resolved before the company's annual stockholders' meeting, scheduled for may 14.     san miguel corp reported sales revenue of 12.2 billion pesos in 1986, 11 pct above its 10.9 billion peso sales in 1985. it said unaudited net profit was in the neighbourhood of 700 mln pesos, an increase of about 50 pct over 1985.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>kuwait has asked at least four countries, including the united states, soviet union, britain and china, for temporary use of their flags or tankers to protect kuwaiti oil shipments in the troubled persian gulf, reagan administration officials said.     the officials confirmed a new york times report that kuwait wants to transfer some of its oil tankers to u.s. or soviet registration in hopes iran would be reluctant to launch new "silkworm" missiles at superpower flags.     the united states has vowed to keep the gulf open to international oil traffic and has warned tehran against using the chinese-made missiles recently installed in iran near the mouth of the gulf.     "they (the kuwaitis) have also asked britain, china and possibly some other european countries to lease tankers to carry their oil," one of the administration officials, who asked not to be identified, told reuters.     the united states is considering the request to temporarily transfer kuwaiti ships to american registration, but such a move could create insurance and other problems, the officials said.     u.s. defense officials told reuters yesterday that kuwait had decided for at least the time being not to accept a u.s. offer to use american warships to escort its tankers in the gulf, where both iran and iraq have been attacking shipping.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>the u.s. dollar opened slightly lower in moderately active trading as bearish sentiment persisted, dealers said.     they said the selling pressure was light ahead of expected meetings of leading finance ministers in washington this week. participants tended to keep their positions small and bank of japan intervention shortly after tokyo's opening at around 145.30 yen failed to have a strong impact on the market, they said.     the dollar opened at 1.8247/57 marks against new york's 1.8270/80 close and the 1.8205/15 finish here yesterday.     the dollar opened at 145.40/50 yen but weakened to near 145.30 when the bank of japan intervened. it finished at 145.60/70 in new york and 145.15/20 here yesterday.     dealers said the dollar appeared to be holding comfortably above the critical 145 yen level now as yesterday's attempt to break that level failed for lack of momentum. but the markets generally are not expecting much from the washington talks today, they added.     the dollar is expected to stay within a tight range today with considerable selling pressure at the 145.60 yen and 1.8270 mark levels, dealers said.     dealers said supportive remarks yesterday from federal reserve chairman paul volcker and japanese finance minister kiichi miyazawa were ignored as players squared positions.     volcker told a congressional committee the dollar's fall so far should be "large enough ... to support widespread expectations of a narrowing in the real trade deficit in the period ahead."     miyazawa, after meeting treasury secretary james baker, said they agreed on the need for currency stabilization and that he was satisfied with the role the u.s. has played in supporting the dollar since the february paris accord.     sterling opened at 1.6182/92 dlrs against new york's 1.6175/85 close and the 1.6200/10 finish here yesterday.     dealers said sterling sentiment remains positive as the ruling conservative party maintained its lead in opinion polls. but they said technical selling may depress it to 1.6150.     the hong kong dollar opened at 7.8005/25 against its u.s. counterpart compared with yesterday's 7.8015/35 close.     local interest rates tended easier with overnight opening at four 3-1/2 pct against yesterday's 4-1/2 four pct close.     asian dollar rates were steady with three months opening unchanged at 6-1/2 3/8 pct.     the dollar started at 1.5147/57 swiss francs against new york's 1.5145/55 close and the 1.5137/47 finish here yesterday, and at 6.0690/0720 french francs against 6.0780/0810 and 6.0600/20.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>german long-term capital inflow slumps in february</TITLE>
<BODY>the inflow of long-term capital into west germany slumped to 606 mln marks in february from january's record 11.91 billion, with foreign purchases of german bonds and shares declining sharply, the bundesbank said.     while foreigners bought only four billion marks worth of german bonds in february after 13 billion in january, they sold a net 500 mln marks in shares and promissory notes of public authorities after sales worth 300 mln in january.     with german investors' purchases of foreign securities steady around 1.3 billion marks, only 2.2 billion marks were imported through securities transactions, after 11.2 billion.     direct investment abroad led to a capital outflow of 1.60 billion marks in february after 2.83 billion in january.     there was a deficit of 8.14 billion marks in the short-term capital account after a surplus of 194 mln in january.     banks alone exported some 8.6 billion marks in funds while domestic companies increased their short-term financial assets abroad by 700 mln. but public authorities received some one billion marks from abroad, the bundesbank said in a statement.     combining long and short term capital outflows, west germany recorded a net outflow of 7.53 billion marks in february against a net inflow of 11.91 billion in january.     the bundesbank confirmed the german trade surplus widened to 10.45 billion marks in february from january's 7.20 billion.     taking the two months together the seasonally adjusted surplus was slightly below the figure for the previous two. in terms of current as well as constant prices, the narrowing of the surplus was progressing, the bank said.     germany's current account surplus widened to 6.63 billion marks in february from 4.79 billion in january, but was down on the 7.26 billion figure for february 1986. seasonally adjusted, the february current account surplus narrowed against january.     while exports in february fell a half pct against the same month last year, imports fell 10-1/2 pct largely due to the drop in prices. exports grew three pct in volume and imports two pct.     in the balance of services, a fall in net investment income led to a 300 mln mark deficit in february after a 300 mln mark surplus in january.     the deficit in transfer payments widened to 3.70 billion marks from 2.69 billion, largely due to a sharp jump to 2.3 billion marks from 200 mln in payments to the european community budget.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>poehl warns against further dollar fall</TITLE>
<BODY>bundesbank president karl otto poehl said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation of the mark would damage prospects for sustained west german economic growth.     in a speech to the institute of contempory german affairs here, poehl said "it would be an extremely risky policy to aim for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to correct the trade deficit."     he said the united states could face a vicious circle of depreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took that route.     poehl noted west germany had already taken steps to meet u.s. demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy, accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and tolerating above-target money supply growth.     he said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for january 1988 to the beginning of this year, but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the west german parliament.     but there were also limits to the impact west germany could accept on exports from a rising mark, he said.     poehl said west germany relied on exports for about one-third of its gross national product, so a substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home.     "a further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth," he said.     poehl said the bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors, including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway.     but poehl said west germany now faced a difficult dilemma over monetary policy.     the underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not the reported negative inflation rates last year, and west germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments.     "for the time being, we will have to focus our policy more on the external side, and we can live with a more expansionary money supply. but we must be very careful," he said.     he said he shared some of the u.s. concern about japan's trade surpluses, which affected european countries as well as the united states.     poehl welcomed the so-called louvre accord of monetary officials of major industrialized countries, saying the importance of the february 22 agreement to stabilize exchange rates had been underestimated.     all partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level, and that further changes would damage growth, he said.     "this was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on the part of our american colleagues," he said.     but he said there was still a danger that the correction of the dollar's value could overshoot.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>citibank norway unit loses six mln crowns in 1986</TITLE>
<BODY>citibank a/s cci.n,, the norwegian subsidiary of the u.s.-based bank, said it made a net loss of just over six mln crowns in 1986 -- although foreign bankers said they expect it to show 1987 profits after two lean years.     citibank's oslo treasury head bjoern sejerstad told reuters, citibank, one of seven foreign bank subsidiaries operating in norway, lost money because of restructuring for investment banking away from commercial banking and an economic slump in norway following last year's plunge in oil prices.     foreign banks have been allowed to operate susbidiaries in norway since 1985.     foreign banking analysts in oslo said access to norway's second-hand securities and equities markets, to be approved later this spring, and lower primary reserve requirements would make profit this year.     citibank lost 490,000 crowns in norway in 1985, but sejerstad said a profit was likely this year because of planned liberalisation and better economic performance, helped by a steadier oil price of around 18 dlrs a barrel.     earlier this year, chase manhattan bank's cmb.n> subsidiary decided to stop foreign exchange trading after heavy losses and focus instead on fee-based merchant banking.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>norway to tighten rules for registering loans</TITLE>
<BODY>norway will from june require finance institutions and insurance companies to report lending volume to the central bank once a month rather than quarterly in a bid to tighten domestic lending, finance ministry officials said.     norwegian bank association president trond reinertsen told reuters the new rule would make it more difficult for banks to transfer funds to financial and insurance companies for lending.     banks have in the past used the two month lapse in loan registration to transfer money for lending to finance and insurance groups to avoid penalty reserve requirements for lending in excess of government set ceilings.     the new rule brings loan reporting requirements for insurance and finance companies in line with those already applied to commercial banks, ministry officials said.     borrowers have increasingly sought loans from finance and insurance companies after the central bank last year clamped down on what it called excessive bank lending.     bank lending dropped by five billion crowns in january from 260 billion crowns the previous month in response to the stricter penalty reserve requirements, oslo bankers said.     they said recent central bank cuts in the overnight rate it charges banks might offset new pressure on interest rates.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>canada lawmakers urge exemption from u.s. bill</TITLE>
<BODY>lawmakers from ontario asked their u.s. counterparts to exempt canada from the mandatory trade retaliation provisions in a major trade bill being considered by the u.s. congress.     at a meeting of the northeast-midwest coalition, an organization of u.s. legislators, david cooke, chairman of the ontario parliament's select committee on economic affairs, said the exemption would help trade relations.     the trade legislation to be considered by the full house in late april would require president reagan to retaliate against foreign unfair trade practices unless the trade actions would harm the u.s. economy.     currently, reagan can reject trade sanctions on any grounds.     cooke, a member of the liberal party, told the u.s. congressmen, "i can understand (the trade bill). i think it has to do with concerns you have with the other parts of the world."     "i would suggest to you that we are your best friends. you do not have those concerns with canada and you should sincerely consider exempting our country from that bill," he added.  reuter </BODY>

"there are obvious problems at the moment in the trade area, but we do not wish those problems to divert attention from important areas of cooperation that continue to exist on security and political issues," he said.     "the question is whether through cooperative actions between our governments we can reduce the (trade) imbalance or whether congress takes action to reduce it through protectionist legislation," he said.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>economic spotlight - excess money hurts thai banks</TITLE>
<BODY>thailand's improving economy may have helped its trade and finance position but it has also created major problems for local banks, thai and foreign bankers said.     they said a 900 mln dlr saving from cheaper imported oil and 19.7 pct export growth last year contributed to the country's first current account surplus in 20 years.     but the bright picture, together with a government program to help farmers cope with depressed commodity prices, coincides with sluggish investment by a private sector still feeling the lingering effects of the 1984-86 recession.     thai banks have had growing surplus funds and difficulties finding borrowers since the third quarter of 1986.     kunthon narkprom, head of the budget and planning division of thai farmers bank ltd, estimated excess liquidity in banks peaked last month at 60 billion baht, three times what he considered normal. bank of thailand figures show total deposits in 1986 grew 12.7 pct to 627.7 billion baht, while lending rose only 3.4 pct to 548.6 billion.     the lending/deposit ratio, which measures bank loans as a percentage of deposits, fell to 86.6 pct last month, the lowest since the 1970s, after averaging 96.6 pct in 1985.     thai banks have cut lending and deposit rates a record six times since january 1986, during which time the average minimum loan rate fell to 11.5 pct from 15.5 and the gross one-year fixed deposit rate to 7.25 pct from 11.     five banks announced last week they would cut their maximum lending rates to small borrowers by one percentage point to 14 pct.     kunthon of thai farmers estimated banks now have a combined 80 billion baht unused overdraft line as many small and medium-size companies delay borrowing in anticipation of more cuts in interest rates.     the record liquidity has seriously hurt the profits of banks, which have been forced to invest idle funds in low-yield government securities.     kunthon said the banks hold four to 10 billion baht in short-term government bonds bought through the bank of thailand's bond repurchase facility, double the normal amount.     thailand's 16 local commercial banks registered one of their worst years in 1986, with overall profits falling over 30 pct after a 14 pct decline in 1985.     kunthon said profits should increase 10 pct this year as the banks adjust to the new interest rate structure.     olarn chaipravat, senior executive vice president of siam commercial bank ltd, told reporters last week the liquidity problem stems partly from the fact most loan demands come from businesses seeking funds for small, labour-intensive projects.     he said there are few large, capital-intensive projects and many borrowers go offshore to meet their requirements.     somboon chinsavananond, thai farmers' fund management executive, said liquidity has been aggravated by the central bank's policy of fixing a stable baht-dollar exchange rate which permits thai companies to import dollar-denominated funds with a minimal risk of currency exchange losses.     he said underlying bearishness towards the u.s. dollar has encouraged foreign borrowers who hope to pay less on loan principal when their loans mature.     thai bankers said central bank governor kamchorn sathirakul last month rejected a request to increase a 10 pct withholding tax on interest on foreign loans, a measure they said would reduce foreign borrowings. the governor replied the bankers should extend more loans to rural areas instead.     bankers said some thai banks have offered credit-worthy clients loans at near money market rates of seven to eight pct in a bid to compete with foreign funds.     a market analyst at siam commercial bank said bank lending at such rates amount to about 15 pct of all loans extended by the industry.     a foreign banker, who requested anonymity, said the "segmented market approach" used by thai banks for setting different lending rates has caused dislocation of funds in the financial sector, eroded bank profits and prevented banks from taking a more logical move of further cutting interest rates.     he said the liquidity problem gives the bank of thailand a perfect opportunity to assert more control on the thai money market.     the bank of thailand is taking "a step in the right direction" by planning to float three billion baht in bonds to mop up part of the surplus, he said, but he added the bank has been lax in using its bond repurchase window as a tool to absorb or inject liquidity into the market.     william wu, head of the treasury unit of chase manhattan bank n.a., said the money market lacks the instruments to absorb liquidity and avoid sharp interest rate fluctuations.     he said the liquidity has fuelled the stock market's strongest rally in seven years and thailand should seize the opportunity to develop the corporate bond market.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>senate report - reagan plans early sdi deployment</TITLE>
<BODY>the reagan administration is secretly developing plans for an early deployment of president reagan's controversial "star wars" anti-missile system, according to a senate study.     "near-term deployment is an absurd and dangerous course for america," said sen. bennett johnston in a statement issued with the report. "it would force us to break the bank, throw out the abm treaty and commit us to an arms race in space."     the reagan administration is engaged in an internal debate over the strategic defense initiative (sdi), as the land and space-based anti-missile system is called, and may decide later this month to reinterpret the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty to justify an acceleration of sdi research to include development and space testing.     johnston, of louisiana, and fellow democrat william proxmire of wisconsin, whose staff prepared the report, accused the administration of covertly seeking early  deployment as a political ploy to commit the united states to strategic defenses even after reagan leaves office in 1989.     "this report exposes the fact that without a presidential directive or congressional consent, the sdi program ... is being changed to pursue a near-term deployment of strategic defenses," proxmire, chairman of the powerful senate appropriations defense subcommittee, said.     "in other words, they're covertly reorienting the sdi program without congressional approval."     reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>thatcher firm as pressure mounts for elections</TITLE>
<BODY>as pressure mounted on british prime minister margaret thatcher to call a june election, she said today that the decision on when to go to the county was hers and hers alone.     she was speaking to parliament after senior members of the ruling conservative party urged her to call elections due in june 1988 a year early in the wake of two more opinion polls giving her party a commanding lead.     asked by a conservative back-bencher for an assurance that the decision was hers alone, and did not depend on "media hype, pressure and speculation," she replied: "the date of the next election will be decided by downing street, not fleet street."     downing street is the prime minister's official residence, fleet street the traditional home of the british national press.     a harris poll for the breakfast-time program tv-am gave the tories 43 pct of the vote, representing a majority of 132 seats in parliament, their biggest lead since the party's landslide victory in the 1983 elections.     in the times of london, a mori poll gave the tories a 92 seat majority. it was the sixth poll to show the ruling party with a big lead over the opposition labour party and the fast-improving centrist alliance.     leading the chorus urging thatcher to go to the polls in june, sir marcus fox, vice-chairman of the influential 1922 committee of conservative back-benchers, said: "i have always felt that it would be june, and this reinforces my view.     "i always thought june was right. we have got most of our legislation through and to go beyond that i do not think would be in the national interest."     another tory back-bencher, anthony beaumont-dark, said: "i have always been an october man, but i think it would be good to get it out of the way now."     their comments came as government officials dismissed speculation about a snap election to coincide with local polls in may, timed to reap maximum advantage from the recent popularity surge, thatcher's successful trip to moscow and labour's current popularity slump.     calls for a may poll were also prompted by tory concern over a steady advance by the alliance, and the possibility that if it continues it could rob the conservatives of an overall majority in parliament.     today's mori poll showed an alliance gain of eight points over the past month in around 100 key marginal seats where the outcome of the next election is likely to be decided.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>dollar steady in europe ahead of washington talks</TITLE>
<BODY>the dollar was steady ahead of a series of meetings of leading finance ministers starting today in washington, despite low expectations for the outcome of the talks and still negative underlying sentiment toward the dollar.     "there's too much disagreement between the japanese and the rest for them to come out with anything unanimous," said one u.k. merchant bank trader, reflecting the general tone.     however, dealers said position squaring helped push the dollar to a final 1.8240/50 marks, up from the opening 1.8195/205 and near yesterday's close of 1.8245/55.     meanwhile, the pound was underpinned by today's opinion poll findings of further strong support for the conservative party, but fear of bank of england intervention limited buying.     dealers said they doubted the u.k. central bank had needed to sell sterling to curb rises today, with the markets so quiet. the bank of england was rumoured to have sold pounds yesterday.     sterling ended at 72.3 pct on the trade weighted index, unchanged from the opening but off 0.1 point from yesterday's finish. it closed at 1.6185/95 dlrs, after an opening 1.6213/23 and previous close of 1.6163/73, and at 2.9490/520 marks, against an opening 2.9540/75 and yesterday's 2.9490/530.     traders said there was little hope that the western financiers will be able to find a lasting solution to the problem of currency instability during the current series of talks in washington.     these are scheduled to start today with an informal group of five (g-5) session.     tomorrow's group of seven meeting - of the u.s., japan, west germany, france, the u.k., italy and canada - is seen as the key meeting.     traders said few operators will be prepared to open positions ahead of news emerging from the talks.     however, some traders said that, given the low level of expectations, the market could be particularly susceptible to signs of accord between the u.s. and japan, which would give the dollar a sharp upward push.     they said interest is still largely centred on the yen, with any fresh dollar weakness expected to show in that market first.     meanwhile, today's comments from u.s. federal reserve board chairman paul volcker failed to have a lasting impact on the market. his statement that a further sizeable dollar fall could be counter-productive aided a brief run-up in mid-afternoon, but there was little followthrough, traders said.     the dollar finished at 145.25/35 yen, up from an opening 145.05/15 but below yesterday's european close of 146.00/10.     it ended at 1.5120/30 swiss francs, against the start of 1.5130/40 and previous final 1.5180/90, and at 6.0650/700 french francs, after beginning at 6.0525/75 and ending yesterday at 6.0660/710.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>no special checks at german banks because of vw</TITLE>
<BODY>banking supervisory authorities are not carrying out any special checks at banks in the wake of the currency fraud scandal at volkswagen ag vowg.f,, a spokesman for the hesse regional state central bank, lzb, said.     but inspectors are paying particular attention to foreign exchange matters in their routine checks at banks, he said in answer to enquiries. there is no evidence rules were broken.     the lzb spokesman was commenting on press reports that banks had "parked" open currency positions for short periods with vw to circumvent regulations limiting the size of open currency positions that can be carried by banks overnight.     the press allegations emerged after vw said it may have lost 480 mln marks as a result of a possible currency fraud.     lzbs are regional branches of the bundesbank. their inspectors also act for the federal banking supervisory office in west berlin, which regulates banking in west germany.     following the 1974 herstatt bank crash on currency speculation, west germany limited a bank's total open positions overnight to 30 pct of shareholders' equity and reserves.     german press reports have said some banks circumvented this rule by selling excess positions to vw, then repurchasing them.     the banking regulations only cover banks. company foreign exchange activities are not subject to the banking regulators.     the lzb spokesman said there were no concrete signs that the regulations had been broken, and it would be irresponsible to instigate a special check just on the basis of the reports.     the lzbs receive monthly balance sheet statistics from banks in their areas, which they check, and they also routinely inspect all banks in greater detail over longer periods.     but lzb officials said it would be hard for inspectors to detect a breach of these rules as they do not check companies and therefore would not see both sides of any parking deal.     "if the managements of the banks have not spotted them, it will be even harder for our inspectors," said one official.     it would be up to the public prosecutors to order special checks on suspicion of breaches of these regulations, they said. prosecutors in brunswick are already investigating the vw currency scandal, and have ordered the arrest of vw's former chief foreign exchange dealer.     breaches of the banking law in this way can be punished by a 100,000 mark fine for the dealers involved, and in extreme cases by removal of the managers if their active involvement is proved.  reuter </BODY>

"it is against this background that we appeal to the international community for assistance," masire said.     he thanked foreign governments for previous assistance, but added, "the needs of the people in rural areas are greater now, not less. we must prevent the human suffering caused by malnutrition."  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>wall street demonstrated its perseverance today as it recovered from an early wave of selling and posted a strong advance at midday. the gain was fueled by a strong auto sector as investors accumulated the stocks in anticipation of bullish news later this week.     the dow industrials, down 10 in the first minutes of the session when a weak dollar and falling bond prices underscored the market's lingering interest rate anxieties, recovered to stand at 2417, up 11 points at midday. the broader market showed less vigor, however, as advances eked out a lead over declines. volume was a strong 106 mln shares.    ford, up over a point for most of the session, stood at 90-5/8, up 1/2. traders said that speculation that the company will announce a stock split and dividend increase at its board meeting on thursday, encouraged the buying. ford rose 2-5/8 yesterday.     general motors rose 1-5/8 to 83-1/8 in anticipation of bullish news coming out of an analysts meeting scheduled for thursday and friday, traders said. chrysler, not expected to make any major announcements this week, fell 1/2 to 57-3/4.     "with the bonds weak this morning, the blue chips have been holding the market up and that advance was sustained by an influx of foreign money," analyst charles jensen of mki securities said. "but poor breadth and poor performance by the transport and utility averages and the fact the market is at the top of its trading band supported in large part by foreign cash, makes this market vulnerable," he said.     traders noted that federal reserve chairman paul volcker's remarks today concerning the dollar's performance and its bearing on monetary policy, injected caution into many investors.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>bankers trust new york corp said it has placed its approximately 540 mln dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to brazil on non-accrual status and that first-quarter net income will be reduced by about seven mln dlrs as a result.     brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term debt on february 22.     u.s. banking regulations do not require banks to stop accruing interest on loans until payments are 90 days overdue, but bankers trust said it acted now because of "the high potential of a continued suspension that would result in reaching the 90-day limit in the second quarter of 1987."     assuming no cash payments at current interest rates are received for the rest of 1987, bankers trust estimated that full-year net income would be reduced by about 30 mln dlrs.     bankers trust said it assumes that debt negotiations between brazil and its commercial bank lenders will lead to the resumption of interest payments.     the negotiations resume in new york on friday when central bank governor francisco gros is expected to ask banks for a 90-day rollover of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term debt that matures on april 15.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>good rains of one to four inches in the past 10 days have boosted moisture-stressed sugar cane crops in the mackay-burdekin region of queensland's central coast, an australian sugar producers' association spokesman said.     as previously reported, the region has been undergoing a severe dry spell, partly relieved by scattered rainfall, since december, following the virtual failure of the summer wet season.     mills in the area have been reporting that their crops are beginning to look healthy and greener and are putting on growth since the rains began, the spokesman said from brisbane.     although the mackay-burdekin crop outlook is much better than it was, there will be some cane losses, the spokesman said. but is too early to say what they will be and more rain is needed to restore sub-soil moisture.     elsewhere, in far north queensland, the bundaberg region and southern queensland, the cane is in excellent condition and some mills are forecasting record crops, he said.     initial 1987 crop estimates will probably be compiled towards the end of may, he said.     the cane crush normally runs from june to december.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>ruding says banks, debtors should take lead</TITLE>
<BODY>dutch finance minister onno ruding said there was a growing feeling in the world bank and the international monetary fund that commercial banks and debtor countries should take a greater lead in assembling new financing packages.     "the imf and the bank may be less inclined to put together large packages like mexico," ruding told reporters in a briefing on this week's semi-annual imf and world bank talks.     ruding, who is also chairman of the imf's policy-making interim committee, said he was reflecting a feeling within the two institutions.     asked whether his comments reflected a feeling the institutions were being unduly pressured by the reagan administration, ruding replied "we should not go in the direction of politicisation of the two institutions."     ruding said "no country large or small should push in that direction."  he said he expected commercial bank lending to debtors to come in for some criticism for the slow pace of lending recently. ruding also said he did not expect any major initiatives to develop a larger commercial bank role in the debt strategy or any new proposals for dealing with the debt crisis itself.     in other remarks, ruding said many countries supported a general capital increase for the world bank and he expected bank president barber conable also to express his support.     the u.s. has said it is opposed to a gci at present.     ruding said the interim committee communique would support the use of indicators to assist multilateral surveillance but would stop short of supporting u.s. proposals for automatic consultations if indicators were sharply out of line with policy objectives. monetary sources say the u.s. has suggested establishing "norms" or automatic triggers for consultations among industrial states if policies deviate from plan.     currently the plan also has the support of france, the netherlands and italy while britain, japan and west germany are all opposed.  reuter </BODY>

"private line service has been grossly underpriced since 1984, and, therefore, it has been subsidized by all long distance users," terry hobbs, assistant vice president said.

<TITLE>japanese automakers turn to four-wheel steering</TITLE>
<BODY>major japanese automakers are gearing up to equip sporty models with four-wheel steering, a feature that could become standard on high-grade cars in the future, automotive industry sources said.     two companies are ready to market such cars soon, they said. honda motor co ltd will sell its prelude with four-wheel steering from this friday, and mazda motor corp officials say a model with the new steering will be out by mid-year. mazda aims to ship the cars overseas before year-end but the decision will depend on initial consumer reaction.     nissan motor co ltd has offered a less sophisticated four-wheel steering system on its skyline since august 1985. toyota motor corp has exhibited its developments in the field at a recent motor show and mitsubishi motors corp said it will use the system in the near future.     though major u.s. and european automakers have also researched and tested the four-wheel system, they say they are waiting to see consumer response to the japanese cars and for further improvements in safety and costs.     four-wheel steering allows drivers to easily manoeuvre into parking spaces and gives more control on sharp turns.      mazda officials believe the new steering will improve safety. "at extremes, four-wheel steering gives a driver more control," said one official. "on slippery surfaces or at high speeds, the system reduces unnecessary movement of the vehicle."     while acknowledging the added vehicle stability, a honda engineer said: "this invention is not intended to improve safety, but is aimed at allowing everyone to drive easily."     mazda's electronic steering system tells the back wheels to turn in the opposite direction from the front wheels at slow speeds but in the same direction at high speeds.     honda's system, which is mechanical, is similar but the direction of the rear wheels is determined by the angle of the front wheels. with nissan's system the rear wheels move only parallel to the front.     automakers say professional drivers who have tested the four-wheel steering say it greatly improves handling.     an official with one u.s. vehicle manufacturer said four-wheel steering is a technical improvement, but it is uncertain whether it will translate into higher sales or profits. "all automakers are interested in something new," he said. "if it becomes a predominant factor, everyone will want to follow."     the official said four-wheel steering is partly a gimmick to sell cars. "it's a benefit of a secondary nature compared with devices for fuel economy or emission control."     general motors corp has developed a four-wheel steering system, but is unlikely to market it within the next five years, y. hojoh, engineer with the japan branch of general motors overseas corp, said. gm must consider the costs to the consumer, he added.     the industry sources said the additional cost of the system in japan would probably make little difference to the consumer as it would be added to already high-priced models.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>u.s. grain certs save 50-100 mln dlrs - amstutz</TITLE>
<BODY>the use of generic commodity certificates, or "certs," for fiscal years 1986-88 will save the government 50 to 100 mln dlrs, department of agriculture undersecretary daniel amstutz said.     speaking at a house agriculture subcommittee hearing on the use of the certificates, amstutz said that the issuance of 8.5 billion dlrs of certificates during fiscal years 1986-88 could result in government outlays of up to 400 mln dlrs.     however, the use of certificates preclude the need for 450 to 500 mln dlrs in storage and handling costs, resulting in net savings for the government of 50-100 mln dlrs, he said.     without the use of certificates, amstutz said nearly the entire 1985 crop which had been put under loan would have been forfeited to the commodity credit corporation, ccc.     in addition, 260 mln bushels of grain that have been redeemed from ccc inventory through certificate exchanges would have remained in the goverment inventory, he said.     when asked to comment on a recent study by the general accounting office that concluded certificates result in a net cost to the government, amstutz said, "gao underestimated the benefits and overstated the costs" of the certificate program.     amstutz said while certificates encourage more loan entries, they also encourage heavier loan redemptions rather than forfeitures.     gao underestimated this net loan activity, amstutz said.     "there is no question in the mind of the department of agriculture that these certificates have been very useful," amstutz said.     immediate benefits of certificates include greater market liquidity, improved market price competitiveness, higher farm income, and improved debt situation and decreased carrying costs, he said.     certificates are an integral part of usda's long-range market-oriented farm policy, he said.     amstutz told subcommittee chairman rep. dan glickman, d-kans., that usda is in the process of preparing an official response to the gao study on certificates and will submit it to the subcommittee when completed.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>currency futures to key off g-5, g-7 meetings</TITLE>
<BODY>news of an agreement among g-5 and g-7 finance ministers meeting in washington this week will be key to the direction of currency futures at the international monetary market, but any such agreement will need to go beyond the paris accord to stem the recent rise in futures, financial analysts said.     "if they (the finance ministers) give the market something really new to look at -- that is, some package that goes beyond the paris agreement -- you could have a real boost in the dollar," said shearson lehman brothers analyst anne mills.     on the other hand, "anything neutral would tend to be bearish for the dollar," mills said.     traders and analysts agree a simple reaffirmation of the paris accord will not be enough to halt the decline in the dollar, nor will central bank intervention.     "a lot of people are looking for a reason to buy currencies and sell the dollar," said one trader for a large retail firm on the floor of the imm.     "if there is no concrete resolution, they will be looking to sell the dollar, possibly down to the 1.80 mark level," he said.     technically, most currency futures are poised for another rise, said smith barney harris upham analyst craig sloane.     sloane noted that june yen futures set a new contract high on tuesday and closed at its best level ever, while june sterling set a new contract high on monday.     "everything seems to be coming to a head right now and you don't need much to get things rolling," sloane said.     in particular, the june canadian dollar, for which sloane recently put out a buy recommendation, has hovered in a range between 0.7600 and 0.7660 in recent weeks, forming a triangle on the charts from which it may soon break out on the upside.     a close above the contract high of 0.7665 would signal a breakout, sloane said, and would likely mean the nearby canadian dollar contract would extend its advance to near the 0.7800 level. june canadian dollar closed at 0.7656 tuesday.     mills noted, however, that interest rate differentials between canadian securities and u.s. securities have narrowed dramatically recently, with yields on 10-year canadian bonds only about 80 basis points above u.s. 10-year notes.     what has helped the canadian currency, she noted, is an increasing proportion of foreign funds flowing into the canadian equity market, particularly from japanese investors.     other analysts, however, said currency futures may be near the top of their long-term rally.     "something will be done at the (g-5 and g-7) meeting to calm people," said david horner of merrill lynch economics.     the paris accord has pretty much fixed where major european currencies will trade, horner said.     but sterling futures may still make another run for new highs, up to 1.6300 to 1.6500 dlr in the june contract, on the positive atmosphere that will prevail before british elections and possibly another interest rate cut, horner said. the june british pound closed at 1.6080 on tuesday.     horner said that new boundaries for the trading range of the yen are likely to come out of the g-5 and g-7 meetings.     the most likely range will be a bottom for the dollar between 140 to 142 yen per dollar and a top near 150 to 152 yen, horner said. in yen futures, the bottom of the dollar's range would be equivalent to 0.007100 to 0.007150 in the june contract. june yen closed at 0.006913 on tuesday.     if such a range does emerge from the meetings, "we will have one more rally in the yen," horner said.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>south africa's economic recovery has broadened as favourable terms of a three-year foreign debt rescheduling accord have given confidence to local business, liberty life association of africa ltd said.     the major life assurance company said in its first quarter review that economic activity improved in 1986 with car and retail sales clearly rising, adding that south africa's economic future had "brightened considerably."     liberty said pre-conditions existed for further growth in 1987 despite longer term structural problems.     short-term interest rates were unlikely to rise markedly in the near future and unemployment levels were stabilising, the company said.     but the report cautioned that south africa's economy still faced high inflation and "extremely fragile" consumer and business confidence which could be upset by political events.     it also predicted the rand was likely to remain basically a weak currency despite its nine pct rise in the first quarter to 49.55 u.s. cts. reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>south africa mines body sees may day work stoppage</TITLE>
<BODY>negotiations between mining companies and the national union of mineworkers are foundering and mines could face a may day work stoppage, the chamber of mines said.     it said the union had called off talks on a specific issue, the introduction of a labour day on may 1.     the union refused a request to give advance notification of the names of workers who would be working on may 1 rather than taking the option of a paid holiday, the chamber said.     it said mining companies wanted advance notice in order to plan their operations.     "the union is adamant only employees who wish to work on labour day should notify management," the chamber said.     "this raises the prospect that the mines will once again face stay-away action on may 1 and that the employees who do not work will once again forfeit pay."     it said the union accepted all the proposals except giving advance notification for may 1.     it said miners had been offered a full paid holiday on may 1 or a premium of six pct of their basic monthly pay for working that day.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>dollar closes little changed in frankfurt</TITLE>
<BODY>the dollar closed virtually unchanged from yesterday's finish, but near the day's high after another extremely quiet session.     with the g-5 meeting in washington ahead of this week's imf interim committee, traders remained reluctant to open any large positions. towards the end of the day the dollar firmed after failing earlier to hold beneath 1.82 marks. some dealers said senate testimony from fed chairman paul volcker also lent support.     the dollar closed at 1.8265/75 marks after opening at 1.8200/15 and closing yesterday at 1.8260/70.     volcker said that a further sizeable dollar decline could be counter-productive, and that exchange rate adjustments have been enough to narrow the u.s. trade deficit.     such remarks in the past might have moved the dollar sharply, today they only pushed it up 20 or 30 basis points when it was already firming for technical reasons.     the dollar in any case held in a narrow range today, trading early in the morning just below 1.82 marks and rising to a high of 1.8270.     dealers said they were awaiting comments after the g-5 meeting from u.s. treasury secretary james baker.     looking slightly further ahead, the market is awaiting u.s. february trade data, due on april 14.     another set of disappointing figures could push the dollar below its recent 1.80-85 mark range if there have been no supportive statements from g-5 officials in washington in the meantime, dealers said.     sterling closed slightly easier at 2.950/954 marks, after opening at 2.951/955 and closing yesterday at 2.954/958.     the pound has been buoyed by expectations the ruling conservatives will win the next u.k. election.     but dealers said sterling now looks high against the mark and room for further gains must be limited.     many dealers believe sterling will enter the ems joint float after a u.k. election. in this case, its ceiling could well be at or near 2.95 marks, dealers said.     the yen closed at 1.2550/70 marks per 100 after closing yesterday at 1.2490/2510, and the swiss franc firmed to 120.55/70 marks per 100 from 120.10/50.     the french franc ended unchanged at 30.04/07 marks per 100.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>gold and silver closed off the day's highs on profit-taking, but silver, which continued to set the pace, remained well up on yesterday's close, dealers said.     underlying speculative demand for silver remained strong but profit-taking eroded the gains, taking the metal off indicated highs at around 6.80 dlrs to close at 6.64/66 dlrs an ounce. yesterday's close was 6.52/54 dlrs.     some investors were noted selling gold and switching into silver. this combined with profit-taking to push gold down to a close of 418.50/419.00 dlrs from its opening 421.80/422.20 and yesterday's 421.50/422.00.     dealers said it was unclear if the silver rally had peaked or if fresh gains could be achieved in new york.     "a lot depends on the dow jones index," one dealer commented. "further gains in stock prices would take away a lot of the support for silver and gold."     platinum ended 50 cents higher at 563/567 dlrs.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>texaco inc made a filing in a texas court of appeals to enjoin the enforcement of the 10.3 billion dlr judgement pending appeal, an attorney for pennzoil co pzl, said.     "they made the filing in the first court of appeals in texas," said john jeffers, an attorney at the houston law firm of baker and botts representing pennzoil.     a spokesman for texaco had no immediate comment. attorneys representing texaco were not immediately available.     the filing follows yesterday's decision by the u.s. supreme court, overturning a lower federal court decision that had cut texaco's bond to one billion dlrs. the high court ruled that the issue should first be considered by texas state courts.     texaco yesterday said it would soon file to prevent enforcement of the bond, but it was unsure whether it would make the filing in a district court, the court of appeals or the texas supreme court.     jeffers said texaco chose the appeals court because it currently has jurisdiction in the case.     according to texas state law, texaco could be forced to post the full amount of the judgement as a bond. if it failed to do so, pennzoil could seek liens on texaco's assets for the amount of the judgement.     texaco's filing contains a request to cut the amount of the bond to between one and 1.5 billion dlrs, jeffers said. asked what pennzoil's thought of that amount, he said, "i don't think it's enough."     pennzoil has repeatedly said it would not seek to force texaco to post the full amount of the judgement in the form of a bond, but has said it would seek other forms of security.     "we've recognized there are other alternatives to a bond," jeffers, the pennzoil attorney, said.     pennzoil will also have the right to respond to the filing but jeffers said he was unsure when the response would be made.     the dispute between texaco and pennzoil stems from the 1984 takeover of getty oil co by texaco. pennzoil said the merger violated a prior agreement it had to buy getty and sued texaco. since then, pennzoil's position has twice been upheld by texas state courts. the judgement now stands at 10.3 billion dlrs, including interest, and is on appeal.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>up to 70 pct of the 240 finance companies operating in sweden are likely to be squeezed out over the next few years by the deregulation of financial markets, the association of swedish finance companies said.     association chairman arne ogren told a news conference that a major restructuring of the sector was inevitable.     central bank governor bengt dennis said when announcing the deregulation in november 1985 that one of his main aims was to give commercial banks a chance to compete on equal terms with finance companies and so undermine sweden's "grey market."     total credit granted by the swedish finance companies rose to 77 billion crowns in 1986 from 64.7 billion in 1985. this includes leasing and is the equivalent of 19 pct of all outstanding loans by the banking sector at end-1986.     ogren said that if proposals now being discussed by a government-appointed inquiry into the credit market to license finance companies and make them increase their share capital were pushed through, up to 70 pct would disappear.     but he said this would in fact have little effect on credit volumes as the 42 biggest finance companies accounted for 70 pct of lending by the entire sector.     the explosive growth of swedish finance companies began in the early 1970s and commercial banks even started their own to get around the tight restrictions then imposed on banking activities and particularly on the growth of lending.     now that they were on an equal footing with their parent companies, many bank-owned finance companies faced an identity crisis, ogren said. he predicted there would be mergers and individual firms would carve out specialised niches to ensure their survival in a deregulated climate.     ogren said the sector's losses on bad loans were bound to rise steeply in 1989-1990 due to the rush to increase credit.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>economic spotlight - australian markets booming</TITLE>
<BODY>australian markets are booming as foreign fund managers redirect capital away from the united states and other traditional markets, analysts said.     high short-term interest rates, a bullish stock market and an increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of fresh funds in the last two months, largely from japanese and u.s. investors, analysts polled by reuters said.     fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in and have settled on australia, britain and canada as they diversify from volatile u.s. dollar instruments, they said.     a one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates in the past month, record share prices and a 10-month high for the currency of 0.71 u.s. dlrs all illustrated the inflow.     official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital are not available, but brokers said they received almost daily inquiries from japan and the united states.     "these people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about and they don't know what to do with it. some of that is ending up here with the attraction of high interest rates and reasonable currency stability," national australia bank ltd economist brian hamley said.     "there is a 'flight to quality'," hamley said. "australia may not be in the best (economic) position, but there aren't too many other countries where you'd want to put your money."     the stronger australian dollar was also attracting investors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against the volatility of the u.s. unit, analysts said.     "we're looking a more favoured market than perhaps the u.s. where some people would be concerned about the value of the u.s. dollar," lloyds bank nza ltd chief economist will buttrose said. "why not put the money in australia where entry is cheap and the currency looks stable?"     but turning that capital into more permanent productive investment depends on government economic policy, he said.     "it will only disappear if people lose confidence in the direction in the economy," buttrose said, adding that offshore investors would carefully watch the government's promised tough economic statement on may 14.     while happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding interest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just as easily reverse the flow -- particularly the japanese, who were badly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the australian dollar and hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said.     "it will remain very edgy money. if something was not to be delivered, if the statement wasn't considered tough enough, one might see a substantial outflow," buttrose said.     offshore investors are eager to see australia take tough economic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and stubborn current account deficit, analysts said.     "they are giving us the benefit of the doubt and i think they would like to leave the money here," buttrose said.     reserve bank policy has also reflected the increased interest in investment in australia and the need to shield japanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations.     reserve governor bob johnston last week acknowledged an element of targeting the rate against the yen in currency policy when he said authorities could not take their "eyes off the yen" because of the crucial role of japanese investors.     analysts said they believed the reserve bank had worked successfully in recent months to keep the australian dollar within the range of 100 to 103 yen.     apart from its recovery against a weak u.s. dollar, the australian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a trade-weighted basis in the last three weeks.     offshore buying has also played a role in the booming australian share market. it has followed wall street and other markets, but is also setting its own trend in response to the weight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into equities, particularly in the gold sector.     the key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3 today, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, while the gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in the same period.     the property sector is also sought after, with japanese companies that have invested heavily in the united states in recent years turning their attention to undervalued real estate, particularly in the tourism field.     analysts pointed to the recent sale of sydney's five-star regent hotel to japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs as indicative of the type of property being sought.     "they think they find good value real estate here which, with long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind of investment australia needs," buttrose added.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>drexel burnham lambert inc is telling clients getting nervous about the volatile u.s. stock market to take a look at european and other foreign stock markets.     "we're still pushing for a fully invested position (in u.s. stocks) but we also recognize the market is up 40 pct since september," says burton siegel, investment strategist.     rein van der does, director of international research, admits to being cautious and somewhat confused about certain developments in the tokyo market, such as nippon telephone shares trading at 250 times earnings.     the firm recently dropped its recommendation on jaguar plc jagry, following a sharp runup in the shares. about the same time, says analyst khaled abdel majeed, drexel issued a buy recommendation on the west german automaker bmw.     he says a new plant and new models brighten the outlook for 1987 and 1988. "the company trades in germany on the parent company's earnings but on worldwide consolidated earnings, the multiple is seven or eight, half that of competitors."     by contrast jaguar's share price to earnings multiple is about 12 and daimler-benz ag is around 14 or 15.     drexel analyst lucille palermo recently upgraded recommendations on some canadian gold stocks. with no recession in sight she sees improved physical demand plus new buying interest from the middle east. also, expectation of a higher inflation rate stimulates demand.     on the supply side she thinks "people are overlooking the problems in south africa."  palermo says all of this will push the bullion price to 475 dlrs an ounce by the end of the year.     her current buy recommendations are agnico-eagle mines ltd aeagf>, american barrick resources corp abx>, and echo bay mines ltd eco>.     palermo also believes the overall canadian stock market has greater potential this year than last. although the canadian dollar has moved up slightly it is below levels of several years ago. "canadian exports of all types look relatively cheap to foreigners - resources, manufactured goods, bonds and stocks."     other european stocks favored by drexel include club mediterranee cmi>, pernod-ricard, royal dutch petroleum rd>, unilever un>, british petroleum co plc bp> and imperial chemical industries plc ici>. drexel cautions u.s. investors that foreign dividends may be subject to withholding tax.  reuter </BODY>
