<TITLE>navistar nav, still expects higher 1987 net</TITLE>
<BODY>navistar international corp chairman donald lennox repeated that benefits from recapitalization are likely to boost future earnings for fiscal 1987.     lennox told the annual meeting that future quarterly and full year earnings from ongoing operations should be "significantly above 1986 results."     in his remarks, lennox said management has no plans to recommend reinstatement of the company's common stock dividend in the foreseeable future.     he said the outlook for the medium duty truck market continues to point to little or no change. but recent order receipts indicate a "firmer tone in the heavy duty truck segment," which could result in a five to eight pct increase in industry shipments for the full year, he said.     after restructuring under the holding company format, the company's present truck and engine subsidiary will be known as navistar international transportation corp. neil springer currently president and chief operating officer of navistar international was named chairman of the new subsidiary.     james cotting, now vice chairman and chief financial officer, was named to succeed lennox as chairman and chief executive officer of navistar international corp. lennox will retire march 31.     shareholders at the meeting approved a change in the company's structure to a holding company format, to be effective april 1.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>singapore securities market considering changes</TITLE>
<BODY>the stock exchange of singapore ltd is looking at a new settlement and clearing system and a corporate disclosure format that would make financial data more readily available, george teo, deputy chairman of the exchange, said.     he told a conference organised by the development bank of singapore ltd that singapore wants to develop the fixed rate securities market. he said a state securities market, along the same lines as the u.s. government securities market, will be developed to provide a benchmark for corporate bonds.     teo said the fixed rate securities market will pave the way for companies to raise fixed rate funds.     referring to a proposed change in the broking commission structure, teo said the exchange is likely to introduce a sliding scale structure instead of a negotiated commission structure. he said the negotiated structure works against small investors, who play an important role in the market.     the market capitalisation of the stock exchange of singapore increased to 42 billion u.s. dlrs in january 1987 from 32 billion u.s. dlrs in early 1986, he said.     teo said the government has picked 15 companies to participate in a privatisation program which strives to create opportunities for investors through the sale of 380 mln dlrs worth of shares a year. it will try to increase alternative investment available to investors, he said.     he cautioned against problems in a more competitive securities market, adding that the possibility of insider trading is increased when securities dealing, corporate finance and investment advisory functions are conducted under one roof. but he said the future direction of singapore's securities industry will be dictated by international trends.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>mixed asian reaction to new rubber pact</TITLE>
<BODY>governments of major asian producing countries have welcomed the conclusion of a new international natural rubber agreement (inra), but growers and traders are unhappy with the development, according to views polled by reuter correspondents.     officials in malaysia, indonesia and thailand, which produce the bulk of the world's rubber, said they expected the new pact to continue to stabilise prices and help their rubber industries remain viable in the long-term.     but traders and growers said they were against the new pact because its buffer stock mechanism was likely to interefere with free market forces and prevent sharp rubber price rises.     the new inra, to replace the current one which expires on october 22, was formally adopted by most of the world's producers and consumers in geneva last friday.     it will be open for signature at the u.n. headquarters in new york from may 1 to december 31 this year and will enter into force provisionally when ratified by countries accounting for 75 pct of world rubber exports and 75 pct of world imports.     malaysian primary industries minister lim keng yaik said the formal adoption of a new pact had dispelled fears of liquidation of some 360,000 tonnes of inra buffer stock rubber and a possible depression of prices.     he expressed confidence that the new inra would continue to keep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as prices rose or fell through its buffer stock system.     malaysia was also happy that in the new inra financing of purchases for the normal buffer stock of 400,000 tonnes and a contingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes would be done through direct cash contributions from members, he said.     under the existing pact, members can borrow from banks to finance inra's buffer stock purchases. this has been viewed with concern by some members who fear the inra may become indebted and ultimately face collapse, like the international tin agreement.     "this will ensure the buffer stock operation is carried out without any financial encumbrance," lim said.      malaysia, the world's largest producer, was seeking cabinet approval to join the new inra and hoped other producers and consumers would also become members, he said.     officials in jakarta said the new pact would bring benefit to indonesia's rubber industry's by stabilising prices.     it was unlikely to collapse like the tin agreement because its new financial provisions had been tightened, they said.     thai officials told reuters they were optimistic the new pact was viable because it strictly limited the extent of debt the inra buffer stock manager might commit to his market operations.      malaysian growers, however, said they preferred a free rubber market because an inra had a tendency to keep prices at levels that were only acceptable to consumers.     "with the inra's ability to keep prices at a certain stable level, consumers are assured of rubber at almost a fixed price, while producers may never see sharp price rises," a malaysian rubber producers council source told reuters.     producers also wanted a free rubber market without the overhang of a 360,000 tonne inra buffer stock which had psychologically prevented price rises, he said.     state plantation officials in sri lanka said prices had been depressed since inra's inception and the creation of a buffer stock, and they seemed unlikely to rise.     sri lanka should not be a member of the inra because it was expensive to maintain a buffer stock, they added.     traders in the region, meanwhile, said prices might be pressured by the new pact in the long term as its potential to stabilise prices and buffer stock capacity would spur producers to produce more.     most malaysian and singapore traders said the new pact's conclusion had little impact on prices and it was unlikely to allow sharp price fluctuations in future.     "the 360,000 tonnes in the inra buffer stock must be liquidated and a free market returned," a malaysian trader said.     japanese traders said the new pact had a chance for success as most world producers and consumers had adopted it, but they questioned the ability of some financially-strapped producers to finance buffer stock operations.  reuter </BODY>

"it's a bad idea. we don't need more money to balance the budget. we need to reduce spending and avoid things that would halt economic expansion," miller told students at the university of pennsylvania's wharton school.     "i think economic growth could be threatened mightily if we have a tax increase or by the perception that we're giving up on deficit reduction," he said.     miller criticised a proposal by house speaker jim wright to put a one pct tax on securities transactions.     he said the tax would probably be ineffective because people would avoid by holding their portfolios in other instruments, like real estate, or simply by not trading as often.     miller said he doubted this proposal would pass.     "i think it is frankly all but political suicide to advocate a tax increase unless the president championed it as well," he said.

<BODY>belgian banks will need greater flexibility to choose their sphere of operations by 1992, when the european community is due to introduce free competition in banking throughout the bloc, generale de banque sa genb.br, president eric de villegas de clercamp told a news conference.     he said at present belgian and italian banks were the most restricted in the ec.     while german banks were free to hold stakes in commercial companies in which they invested capital, belgian banks could do so only in severely limited circumstances for short periods.     "the authorities concerned should introduce within a reasonable period major modifications toward greater freedom and flexibility if we want to retain competitiveness with the neighbouring countries," de villegas said.     he said the ec authorities envisaged that after 1992 financial institutions would be able to start operations throughout the ec.     since the control of each institution would remain in the hands of the authorities in its country of origin, rules applied in member states could distort competition unless they were harmonised.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>mulford sees more bank loans to debtors in 1987</TITLE>
<BODY>u.s. treasury assistant secretary david mulford said he foresaw substantial net new commercial loans to the major debtor countries in 1987.     in testimony before a senate banking subcommittee, mulford said he based this prediction on progress in talks between banks and mexico, chile, and venezuela, as well as progress in negotiations with the philippines.     "these agreements, together with others for argentina and we hope brazil," should assure substantial new loans this year, mulford said.     mulford defended the u.s. strategy for handling the debt crisis and added additional steps, like development by commercial banks of a menu of options to support debtor reform, can be undertaken.     that particular development would maintain broad bank participation in new financing packages to debtors.     mulford stessed that greater flexibility in devising new money packages may be essential for future bank syndications.     "the commercial banks have much to gain from taking the lead themselves to develop the kinds of ideas that help assure the concerted lending process works," he said.     in particular, mulford said banks and debtor nations will increasingly move toward repricing, retiming or rescheduling agreements as an alternative to new loans.     "the benefits of such approaches may be substantial and may, in the right circumstances, be easier to achieve than new money packages," he said.     but for debtors with substantial financing needs, new lending will still be necessary, he said.     mulford rejected congressional ideas for a debt facility as being far too costly to creditor governments, and ultimately taxpayers.     mulford urged further development of debt-equity swaps as well as broader mutual funds for conversion into equity.     as in the past, mulford said progress must be founded on economic reforms and sufficient new financing for debtors both to support those reforms and generate new growth.  reuter </BODY>

"brazil's unilateral moratorium on debt service payments underscored the potential for polarization between bankers and debtor countries," s and p said.     s and p noted that while argentina, brazil, mexico and venezuela each face unique economic problems, the lack of progress toward moderating their debt service burdens has been disappointing.     however, the agency pointed out that a substantive improvement in the large banks' financial positions has acted as a counter-balance to the latin american debt situation.     citing increasing financial strength, s and p said it affirmed the debt ratings of citicorp cci>, bankers trust new york corp bt>, bank of boston corp bkb> and j.p. morgan and co inc jpm>.     s and p noted that most u.s. bank holding companies have what it termed easily realizable capital resources available to them, such as undervalued real estate, appreciated portfolio securities and overfunded pension plans.     "most bank managements appear committed to improving the quality of their balance sheets," s and p said, noting many now emphasize long-term strategies over short-term earnings.     standard and poor's reduced chase manhattan's senior debt to aa-minus from aa, subordinated debt to a-plus from aa-minus and preferred stock to a from a-plus. the commercial paper of the parent and its unit chase manhattan bank of canada were affirmed at a-1-plus.     chase has 3.2 billion dlrs of debt outstanding. it has 6.4 billion dlrs of loans to argentina, brazil, mexico and venezuela - one of the highest exposures to lesser developed countries among u.s. money centers.     chase's underlying profitability remains at median levels because of its high expense structure, s and p said.     s and p cut chemical's and the unit chemical new york n.v.'s senior debt to aa-minus from aa and subordinated debt to a-plus from aa-minus.     about 1.2 billion dlrs of long-term debt was affected.     the agency cited chemical's relatively large exposure to latin american borrowers, particulary brazil and mexico, continued high levels of nonperforming assets and the pending acquisition of texas commerce.     aggregate exposure to argentina, brazil, mexico and venezuela was almost four billion dlrs at year-end 1986, or 105 pct of equity and reserves, s and p pointed out.     irving's senior debt was reduced to a-plus from aa-minus, with subordinated debt and preferred stock lowered to a from a-plus. its commercial paper was affirmed at a-111-1plus.     irving has about 500 mln dlrs of debt outstanding. its approximately 1.4 billion dlrs of loans to the four major latin debtor countries account for 110 pct of year-end equity and reserves.     s and p downgraded manufacturers hanover's senior debt to a from a-plus, subordinated debt to a-minus from a and preferred stock to bbb-plus from a-minus but affirmed its a-1 commercial paper. the bank has 3.8 billion dlrs of debt.     s and p noted that manufacturers has about 6.7 billion dlrs of loans to the major latin debtor nations and has experienced weak earnings.     however, the unit cit group holdings inc's aa-minus senior debt and a-1-plus commercial paper were affirmed.     the rating agency cut mellon's senior debt to a-plus from aa and preferred stock to a from aa-minus. it has 1.1 billion dlrs of debt securities.     the commercial paper programs of mellon bank canada and mellon australia ltd, guaranteed by the parent company, were lowered to a-1 from a-1-plus.     s and p cited continued lower operating earnings and rising nonperforming assets and charge-offs for mellon.     security pacific's 1.7 billion dlrs of debt was downgraded. cut were its senior debt to aa from aa-plus, and subordinated debt and preferred stock to aa-minus from aa.     security pacific overseas finance n.v.'s debt issues were reduced to aa from aa-plus. affirmed were the parent's a-1-plus commercial paper and the bbb-rated debt of the unit security pacific financial systems.     these actions reflected security pacific's continued high levels of nonperforming assets and charge-offs, s and p said.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>siemens sees sales near 52 billion marks this year</TITLE>
<BODY>world group turnover of siemens ag sieg.f, should rise to 51 or 52 billion marks in the current year to september 31 after a 19 pct upturn in the first five months, management board chairman karlheinz kaske said.     siemens reported world group turnover in 1985/86 of 47.02 billion marks.     kaske told the annual shareholders meeting turnover rose to 21.2 billion marks in the first five months of 1986/87, about 19 pct above the same year-ago period. the rise was mainly due to payment in january for a west german nuclear power station which led to a jump in domestic sales of 36 pct.     in the first five 1986/87 months, turnover abroad showed a three pct increase, kaske said, without giving figures.     in the same period incoming orders rose five pct to 21.8 billion marks against the same 1985/86 period.     for the year as a whole incoming orders should rise between one and two billion marks to around 51 or 52 billion.     apart from payments for the nuclear power station, the communications and telecommunications sectors in particular should contribute to growth this year, kaske said.     but it was not possible to make a profit forecast for 1986/87 because of uncertainty about the direction of the dollar, kaske said.     siemens already reported that first quarter 1986/87 group net profit fell marginally to 296 mln marks from 298 mln in the same period in the previous year.     turnover in the first five months rose particularly strongly in the installations and automotive technology, communications and telecommunications sectors, but components and energy and automation showed a sharp decline.     kaske said domestic orders rose to 10.2 billion marks in the first five months of this year, or nine pct above their level in the same 1985/86 period, boosted in particular by orders for the fully owned kraftwerk union ag subsidiary.     foreign orders grew one pct to 11.6 billion marks. an increase in orders through newly acquired subsidiaries abroad was balanced by the decline in the dollar.     while the installations and automotive technology sector showed a sharp rise in orders, energy and automation and communications orders were below the level achieved in the same period of 1985/86.     telecommunications orders remained at roughly the same level.     kaske said investments were expected to remain around six billion marks in 1986/87 after a 50 pct increase the previous year. research and development were likely to rise 13 pct to 6.1 billion marks or around 12 pct of turnover.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>malaysian central bank sees higher 1987 growth</TITLE>
<BODY>gross domestic product (gdp) growth in 1987 is expected to grow by between 1.5 and two pct, up from one pct in 1986, the central bank said.     the forecast compares with the one pct gdp growth forecast made by the treasury last october.     bank negara also said in its annual report that gross national product (gnp) is expected to grow by 3.5 to four pct, after declining 7.3 pct in 1986.     it said that a turnaround in investor confidence since last november had been spurred by a moderate improvement in oil and commodity prices and a rise in manufacturing exports.     growth in 1987 is expected to come from the anticipated rise in export earnings if the industrialised countries sustain their average gnp growth at 2.5 to three pct, it added.     bank negara said its forecast assumes that crude oil will average 15.50 dlrs a barrel, rubber at 210 cents a kilo, palm oil at 850 ringgit a tonne, tin at 17 ringgit a kilo and a rise of 12 pct in manufacturing exports.     it said malaysia's international terms of trade will turn around to rise by two pct in 1987 after declining 12 pct in 1986 and five pct in 1985.     "in 1987, income will be higher, private consumer spending is likely to recover and expand... the budget will remain under strict control... the resource gap in the government's finances on current account will be bridged over the near term," bank governor jaafar hussein said in the report.     the current account deficit is expected to narrow to 1.19 billion ringgit in 1986 or 1.8 pct of gnp from 1.79 billion or 2.5 pct of the gnp the previous year.     the bank forecasts the inflation rate will increase by 1.5 pct, after its 0.7 pct rise in 1986.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>iadb meeting ends with u.s. isolated on reform</TITLE>
<BODY>the united states remained isolated among the inter-american development bank's 44 members as the bank ended its annual meeting here today without agreement on u.s. proposals to reform the regional lending institution.     the three-day meeting was dominated by the dispute and by the failure of brazil and its creditor banks to make any breakthrough on debt talks after brasilia suspended interest payments last month.     brazil's central bank governor francisco gros said after talks with its 14-bank advisory committee here yesterday that it could not make a token interest payment now, as sought by banks, but would maintain contact with the banks.     delegates agreed to shelve discussion of iadb reforms until the half-yearly international monetary fund and world bank meetings in two weeks time in washington at which a decision will be urgently sought in order to maintain credit flows to the recession-hit region.     "the bank cannot maintain an adequate lending level unless it is given increased resources," iadb president antonio ortiz mena told a press conference.     ortiz mena said 42 countries opposed washington's proposal to lower veto power over loans to 35 pct of the bank's voting shares from a simple majority as at present.     u.s. treasury secretary james baker said monday the united states, as 34.5 pct shareholder and provider of the bulk of the bank's resources, should have more say in approving loans and conditioned a nine billion dlr increase in its contribution on approving the reforms.     but ortiz mena said latin america and the non-regional members including europe and japan had all supported a 40 pct veto level. canada declined to state a position.     behind the dispute was a u.s. attempt to radically change the direction of the bank, which has lent 35 billion dlrs to latin america in its 28 years, and give it a bigger role in the current debt strategy with increased lending but more stringent conditions attached.     but ortiz said the bank cannot divert too much of its resources to so-called sectoral lending, whereby loans to specific sectors are tied to economic reforms, because this could affect the bank's triple a rating as a borrower in world markets.     "for this reason we have agreed to limit sectoral loans to 25 pct of the total, leaving the rest for investment in projects," he said.     ortiz mena earlier told the bank's closing session that as a result of negotiations here, the bank can expect a new injection of about 25 billion dlrs for the period 1987-90.     the united states has said it will only be able to support a level close to the sixth replenishment of funds, which came to 15.7 billion dlrs, unless its proposals are accepted.     but despite the impasse, some latin american delegates including mexican finance minister gustavo petricioli said they were optimistic a compromise agreement could be reached next month.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>macao to keep existing system for 50 years</TITLE>
<BODY>portuguese prime minister anibal cavaco silva said portugal would hand back macao to china on december 20, 1999, but added the existing political, economic and social system there would be maintained until the year 2050.     cavaco silva, speaking on national television hours before the initialling in peking of an agreement on the handover, said that under the accord macao would be a special administrative region of china and would have a large measure of autonomy.     under the accord, portuguese administration of the territory would end on december 20, 1999 but the existing system there would be maintained until the year 2050, cavaco silva said.     "the existing way of life in macao, the portuguese laws, basically our political, economic and social system, will remain in force for a further 63 years from now," he said.     cavaco silva said he would go to peking in the first half of next month to formally sign the agreement with china, which would then be submitted to portugal's parliament for approval.     cavaco silva said that after portuguese administration of macao formally ended in 1999, the future government of the territory would enjoy complete autonomy except in the areas of defence and foreign relations. it would however be able to make economic, trade and finance agreements with other countries.     the head of government would be named on the basis of elections held for the post.     macao would have an elected legislative assembly and an independent judiciary. there would be religious freedom, a free press and freedom of expression. the portuguese language could continue to be used in the government, assembly and courts.     cavaco silva said the current financial system would continue after the year 2000. the existing banks and freedom of capital movements would be maintained as would the convertibility of the pataca as the territory's monetary unit and the legal protection of foreign investment.     only the macao government would be able to collect taxes.     cavaco silva said that those among macao's 400,000 population who held portuguese nationality on the date of the handover would thereafter continue to be able to use their portuguese passports and their nationality rights.     the nationality issue had been one of the points of disagreement in the complex handover talks.     the special administrative status to be granted to macao after its handover mirrors a similar accord for the nearby british colony of hong kong, which reverts back to chinese rule in 1997 under a 1984 sino-british agreement.  reuter </BODY>

"i don't think it's (a tax increase) is a very good idea and i'm quite confident that president reagan doesn't think it's a very good idea," baker said in an interview on cable news network's "moneyline" television program.     he said u.s. taxpayers are taxed at a rate of 19 pct of gnp which is traditionally where it has been, but the federal government is spending at a rate of 24 pct of gnp. baker said spending cuts are clearly the best way to cut budget deficits.     baker said he opposed a stock transactions tax proposed by house speaker jim wright, d-tex, or other special taxes.     "the stock transfer tax would be a particularly unfortunate approach to take," the treasury secretary said. he said the united states has some of the most efficient capital markets in the world and new taxes would impair efficiency.     on the international front, baker said banks must do more lending to developing countries. he was questioned about this after the standard and poor's corp downgrading today of the debt of six major money center bank holding companies, largely because of their heavy developing nation loan exposure.     baker said that developing countries must adopt free market economic policies such as in the united states. he said capital flows will be required to support the needed reforms in the economic systems of those countries.     the money must come either through equity or debt and baker said that developing nations' "investment regimes do not support enough equity investment, so you've got to have some debt there."     commenting on the u.s. trade deficit, baker said "i think you're going to see a 15 to 20 billion dlr reduction this year."  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>u.s. sugar policy may self-destruct, congressman</TITLE>
<BODY>a leading u.s. farm-state congressman, jerry huckaby, d-la., warned he will press next year for legislation to control domestic production of sweeteners, perhaps including corn sweeteners, if the industry fails to voluntarily halt output increases this year.     "we're moving toward a direction where we could self-destruct (the u.s. sugar program)," rep. huckaby, chairman of the house agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugar issues, told reuters in an interview.     huckaby, who told u.s. sugarbeet growers earlier this year they must halt production increases, said he will deliver the same message to louisiana sugarcane growers friday. he also said he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject.     huckaby said the campaign to urge a halt to domestic sweetener output increases is an effort to forestall further cuts in the sugar import quota, now at one mln short tons.     "i think if we're talking about dropping (the quota) another half mln tons, lets say, you're getting to the point where the program might not work," he said.     "ideally, i'd like to freeze things right where we are," said huckaby, leading advocate for sugar growers in congress.     a freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about the current level of 6.5 mln tons, the corn sweetener share of the u.s. market staying at just over 50 pct, and u.s sugar imports holding at about 1.2 mln tons, huckaby said.     a decision on whether to seek legislation will not be made until 1987 output numbers are known late this year, he said.     "i feel like if we didn't expand production, we could probably hold where we are indefinitely, or at least through the 1985 farm bill without any changes (in the sugar program)," huckaby said.     however, much depends on whether high-fructose corn syrup producers continue to expand their share of the u.s. sweetener market from just over 50 pct, huckaby said.     he noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners will capture at most only another 10 pct of the sweetener market in the u.s.     but he said if there were an economic breakthrough in the production of a new crystalline corn sweetener which further expanded the corn sweetener share, then u.s. sugar imports might be eliminated and u.s. sugar output severely reduced.     huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refiner companies such as a.e. staley and archer daniels midland soon.     "this program is advantageous to the corn users. they have some natural, legitimate self-interest in seeing that the program is preserved," huckaby said.     huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives to think about how domestic output could be controlled, either through production allocations, acreage or marketing controls.     huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from the justice department to determine if it would be legal to ask corn refiners to limit production.     "i don't know if we will go this route, but if we do there's a question in my mind at this point in time; can you do that legally?" he said.     asked if he would proceed with production controls without the support of corn refiners, huckaby said "you build a fragile house if you do it that way."     huckaby said he understands why u.s. cane and beet farmers have expanded production, because high sugar price support means returns from sugar are higher than competing crops such as soybeans and grain.     but he said for sugar growers as a whole, expansion would not be good policy.     huckaby said he has tried to stress, in his speeches to sugar industry groups, that if growers continue to expand, they may be penalized retroactively under any production control legislation passed next year.     huckaby said congress is unlikely to approve any changes in the sugar program this year despite a reagan administration proposal to drastically slash the program.     "the administration proposal is so drastic, that i don't think it will get up a head of steam," huckaby said.     he said even a more moderate proposal to reduce sugar price support is unlikely to be approved.     instead of seeking to slash the domestic sugar program, huckaby said the reagan administration should file a complaint with the general agreement on tariffs and trade against the european community's sugar policy. he said ec policies are the major cause of the depressed world sugar market.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>the composition of the senate agriculture committee, in question since the death of nebraskan democratic sen. edward zorinsky, remains in doubt.     zorinsky's death earlier this month cut the democrats' majority on the committee to 9-8.     zorinsky's replacement, republican david karnes, has said he would like a seat on the panel, and senate republican leader robert dole (r-kan.) is said to have thrown his support behind karnes, who would add a midwestern vote to the panel.     but karnes' appointment to the committee would require at least one republican to step off the committee.     aides to republican sens. mitch mcconnell (ky.) and pete wilson (calif.), whose spots on the panel were rumored to be in jeopardy, said their bosses were categorically opposed to being pushed off the committee.     committee chairman patrick leahy (d-vt.) told reuters he had rejected a suggestion that democrats and republicans each add one member to the committee.     leahy said he would be "delighted" to have freshman sen. john breaux (d-la.) join the committee. but breaux's appointment was being resisted by midwestern democrats, who feel southern states are adequately represented on the committee.     an aide to sen. james exon (d-neb.) said the senator, supported by midwestern democrats, had not ruled out the possibility of moving to the committee.     the inability of the two parties to settle the matter could increase the possibility that the democratic majority would be left untouched at 9-8.     the issue is expected to be resolved any day, senate staff said.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>mulford says g-6 wants stability</TITLE>
<BODY>treasury assistant secretary david mulford said the paris agreement among leading industrial nations is intended to produce "reasonable stability" in exchange markets over the next few months.     he told a senate banking subcommittee the group of five nations and canada agreed in paris to "see if there can't be a period of reasonable stability instead of volatility" to give time for the committments in paris to take place.     asked by sen phil gramm (r-tex) whether u.s. intervention was not in fact overvaluing the dollar, mulford replied that the administration judged that after economic adjustments, current exchange rates reflect underlying economic fundamentals.     in particular, the stability sought by the nations would allow west germany and japan to stimulate their economies domestically and the u.s. to cut its budget deficit, mulford said in his testimony.     he stressed that a further sharp fall in the dollar would hurt the ability of germany and japan to boost growth.     mulford noted that half of west germany's economy was affected by international developments.     he also said increased japanese domestic growth would result in more u.s. exports to japan and would not necessarily lead to greater japanese capital flows to the u.s., as gramm asserted, if japan reformed its domestic capital market.     commenting on the paris agreement, mulford said, "i think exchange rates ought to be stabilized so (germany's and japan's) efforts can be carried out.     mulford rejected gramm's argument that faster domestic growth in germany and japan would result in an even lower dollar.     mulford said the administration wanted to achieve a pattern of higher growth overseas as a way of improving the u.s. trade deficit.     otherwise, he said, the trade deficit would be resolved either through a much lower dollar or a u.s. recession, both alternatives he termed unacceptable and undesirable.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>japan beef price support cut will not raise demand</TITLE>
<BODY>japan's plan to cut beef intervention prices for the fiscal year starting april 1 will not boost demand because of strict supply controls and a complex distribution system, japanese and u.s. industry sources said.     "government beef policy protects farmers rather than meeting consumers' demands and the cutback ... is too marginal," a housewives association of japan official said.     despite mounting u.s. pressure on japan to open farm markets, beef is strictly controlled by the government, which maintains a price stabilisation zone to protect farmers.     under the plan, expected to be announced this month, the standard or bottom price of castrated wagyu -- known as marbled beef -- will be set at 1,370 yen per kilo for 1987/88 against 1,400 now, and the ceiling at 1,780 yen against 1,820.     the standard price of other beef, mainly produced from dairy steers, is set at 1,020 yen against 1,090 and the ceiling at 1,325 against 1,420.     ministry officials said the semi-government livestock industry promotion corp (lipc) conducts buffer stock operations to help keep wholesale beef prices within the intervention price zone.     the lipc is allowed to import most beef, with the amount set by the government under a quota system. when wholesale prices go above the ceiling, the lipc releases its beef stocks, both domestic and imported, and buys locally produced beef when prices are below.     but the lipc has often been criticised for releasing beef stocks when the prices are higher than the ceiling.     phillip seng, asian director of the u.s. meat export federation, told reuters the two pct cut in prices is a step toward closing the gap with european community prices, about half those in japan.     but seng said the cut will not benefit consumers or u.s. meat exporters because of japan's rigid and complicated distribution system and strict supply control by the lipc.     the housewives association official said retail beef prices are high mainly because of distribution problems and high production costs, as well as poor operations by the lipc.     american meat packers see japan as a promising market. f.c. beatty, of u.s. packer john morrell and co, told the japan times beef cuts, which sell for 1.20 to 3.00 dlrs a pound in the u.s., are sold at 15 to 30 dlrs in japan.     but seng said the cut will not benefit consumers or u.s. meat exporters because of japan's rigid and complicated distribution system and strict supply control by the lipc.     the housewives association official said retail beef prices are high mainly because of distribution problems and high production costs, as well as poor operations by the lipc.     american meat packers see japan as a promising market. f.c. beatty, of u.s. packer john morrell and co, told the japan times beef cuts, which sell for 1.20 to 3.00 dlrs a pound in the u.s., are sold at 15 to 30 dlrs in japan.     but industry sources said it is unclear how much demand will pick up if retail beef prices drop following any sharp reduction in intervention prices.     u.s. agriculture secretary richard lyng said this week he will ask japan to remove all beef import restrictions when he visits here next month.     in 1984, japan decided to increase its beef import quota by 9,000 tonnes a year until march 31, 1988.     in 1987/88, the quota will rise to 177,000 tonnes from 168,000 in 1986/87, ministry officials said, adding japan wants to keep self-sufficiency in beef at around 70 pct.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>efforts by governments to control wheat surpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partial success, the international wheat council (iwc) says in its latest monthly report.     faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducing both price and areas, as employed in the united states, the iwc says in a survey of support prices in the five main wheat exporters - argentina, australia, canada, the ec and the u.s.     in some countries, for example australia and argentina, which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for export income, there may be problems in reducing production.     a policy of cutting wheat production could lead to unemployment, with job prospects outside agriculture limited. alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could then lead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems.     the iwc outlines three courses of action open to governments in wheat exporting countries.     they could continue to support prices in the hope that when the world economy improves demand for wheat will rise and surpluses wil be reduced or eliminated.     alternatively, support could be limited to wheat which could be easily sold, without needing to be stored for a long period.     this option may prove to be the most politically unattractive and would result in many producers abandoning wheat production, the report said.     the third option would be for governments to distinguish between the commercial and social aspects of agriculture, possibly varying support prices according to farm size or overall production.     the iwc review covers support prices in the major exporting countries since 1982. at some time during that period all the producers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses.     these changes did not always result in lower export subsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more than offset lower prices in the domestic currency.     for example between 1985/86 and 1986/87 the ec intervention price for bread wheat fell from 209.30 to 179.44 european currency units (ecus). it dollar terms, the currency in which most export transactions are denominated, the intervention price however rose to 193 dlrs from 168. the high cost of supporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers and some governments are now searching for ways to cut expenditure, the report says.     the proportion of world wheat output produced by the five major exporters declined in the period covered by the survey from 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987. this was partly due to increased production in china and india.     the period saw an upward trend in yields, although this was countered in the argentina, the u.s. and australia by lower acreages.     in argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 per cent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch to other enterprises, particularly livestock while lower u.s. acreages are attributed to official incentives.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>krupp has satisfactory 1986 results</TITLE>
<BODY>the fried. krupp gmbh krpg.d, steel and engineering group said it had a satisfactory 1986 despite a provisional 12 pct fall in total group sales to 18.1 billion marks from 20.7 billion the previous year.     third party turnover declined to 15.9 billion from 18.5 billion in 1985 while orders slipped to 15.5 billion marks from 16.9 billion, it said in a preliminary statement.     despite these figures, which reflected the dollar's weakness against the mark and oil and raw materials price falls, it said 1986 was a satisfactory year.     the reason was the continued expansion of the machinery and plant sector, which accounted for 42 pct of total sales.     krupp added that some areas of the mechanical engineering business achieved notable growth rates and acquisitions had underpinned machinery and component activities.     an orders decline in the steel and, in particular, the trading and services sectors, affected the group's total order figures.     however, "all business sectors contributed to the positive results achieved in 1986," krupp added, without giving details.     domestic orders decreased by five pct to 9.6 billion marks from the previous year and foreign orders fell 14 pct to 5.9 billion, it said. foreign business accounted for 38 pct of orders against 40 pct in 1985.     orders received by the machinery and plant sector, 11 member companies which comprise the core area of the group, rose by four mln marks last year to 6.9 billion, krupp said.     the group's orders in hand amounted to 9.1 billion marks at end-december 1986 from 10.3 billion at the start of the year.     orders received by the steel sector last year decreased by three pct to 6.2 billion marks from 1985, it said.     the steel market weakened increasingly over the year, mainly because of exchange rate movements, the deterioration in foreign trade and a downturn in a number of customer industries.     the difficult market for sections and flats of quality steel depressed order tonnages by around seven pct, krupp said. but special steel boosted by strong demand for stainless cold-rolled flats, grew by five pct in tonnage terms.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>cocoa council head to present buffer compromise</TITLE>
<BODY>international cocoa organization, icco, council chairman denis bra kanon will present a compromise proposal on buffer stock rules to producer and consumer delegates either later today or tomorrow morning, delegates said.     bra kanon held private bilateral consultations with major producers and consumers this morning to resolve outstanding differences, mostly on the issues of how much non-member cocoa the buffer stock can purchase and price differentials for different varieties.     delegates were fairly confident the differences could be worked out in time to reach agreement tomorrow.     some consuming member nations, including britain and belgium, favour the buffer stock buying more than 10 pct non-member cocoa, delegates have said.     the consumers argue that buying cheaper, lower quality non-member cocoas, particularly malaysian, will most effectively support prices because that low quality cocoa is currently pressuring the market.     producers, meanwhile, say non-member cocoa should make up at most a very small percentage of the buffer. they say malaysia should not be able to benefit from the icco unless it is a member, and if the buffer stock bought malaysian cocoa malaysia would have no incentive to join, delegates said.     as to differentials, ghana apparently wanted a higher differential for its cocoa than is outlined in the most recent proposal, so it would have a better chance of having its cocoa bought for the buffer stock, producer delegates said.     some consumers wanted differentials to be adjusted in a way that would not promote buffer stock purchases of the more expensive cocoas, such as ghanaian and brazilian, they said.     other technical points need to be sorted out, including limits on how much cocoa the buffer stock manager can buy in nearby, intermediate and forward positions and the consequent effect on prices in the various deliveries, delegates said.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>fed chairman volcker says bank proposals a worry</TITLE>
<BODY>the chairman of the federal reserve board, paul volcker, has written to the chairman of the house banking committee to raise concerns about legislative proposals scheduled for consideration wednesday.     volcker told committee chairman fernand st. germain a proposal to deny primary dealer status to firms from countries that do not grant u.s. firms equal access to their government debt markets might invite retaliation against u.s. firms abroad.     he added, "even japan, against whom this proposal seems to be particularly directed," has started opening its markets.     in his letter, made available at the treasury, volcker also said a proposal to ease debt problems of developing countries by setting up a public facility to buy their debts owed to commercial banks, was a problem.     "i believe that the prospect of debt relief would undermine the difficult internal efforts of the borrowing countries to achieve the structural reform that is needed regardless of the policies that are followed on servicing external debt," volcker said.     it might also cause private lenders to become reluctant to extend more credit to the borrowing countries, he said.     volcker said he endorsed comments by treasury secretary james baker "about the inappropriateness of using public resources for purchasing private commercial bank debt, which we both see as an inherent aspect of the proposed international debt facility."     he also said a proposal for establishing formal procedures for international negotiations on currency exchange rates "is unrealistic and could well have damaging effects."     "for example, the bill's directive to intitiate negotiations in order to achieve a competitive exchange rate for the dollar -- a matter upon which there can be considerable difference among analysts -- runs the risk of building up potentially destabilizing market expectations," volcker said.     he recommended "we should not lock ourselves into formalized procedures for international negotiations" on exchange rates but instead use other, more flexible means like the recent mmeting in paris between u.s. treasury and central bank representatives and those of major trade allies.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>lower u.s. soybean loan idea sharply criticized</TITLE>
<BODY>u.s. soybean lobbyists and congressional aides criticized a proposal from a senior agriculture department official that congress allow the u.s. soybean loan level to be officially lowered to 4.56 dlrs per bushel next year.     "i don't know who in congress would propose that happening. politically it would be totally unacceptable," an aide to a senior farm-state senator said.     usda undersecretary daniel amstutz said this week that congress should give usda authority to keep the soybean loan  at its current effective rate of 4.56 dlrs per bushel rather than increasing it to its minimum allowed level of 4.77 dlrs.     "i'm convinced that congress will not go along with this," american soybean association president dave haggard said.     amstutz told reporters following a senate hearing that if the soybean loan rate were 4.56 dlrs, usda could then consider ways to make u.s. soybeans more competitive.     his comments were seen as possibly indicating what the  the administration's position is in the debate over what should be done to make soybeans competitive and at the same time protect soybean farmers' income.     using soybean specific certificates to further buydown the loan rate or implementation of a marketing loan have been pointed to as the most effective ways to get soybean prices competitive. usda secretary richard lyng, however, continues to maintain his opposition to a marketing loan, saying such a move would be too costly.     "there will be alot of other options that will be considered before congress looks at that one (the amstutz proposal," said bill o'conner, aide to rep. edward madigan (r-ill), ranking minority leader of the agriculture committee.     "anybody representing large groups of soybean producers would not be very excited about supporting a lower soybean loan," o'conner said.     congress may very likely look at the soybean loan and decide that they cannot increase it from its current 5.02 dlr basic rate, but that there has to be something mandated to increase soybean's competitiveness, david graves, aide to sen. thad cochran (r-miss) said. cochran, a staunch supporter of a soybean marketing loan, would support a soybean loan of 5.02 or 4.77 dlrs with a certificate buydown, graves said.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>economic spotlight - hong kong's more active role</TITLE>
<BODY>hong kong's government has long kept intervention in the economy to a minimum in the belief that when it comes to business, businessmen generally know best.     but the government is slowly being forced to take a more active economic role, partly to face the challenge from fast growing economies like south korea and taiwan and economic powerhouse japan, businessmen said.     the government announced this month it will spend six mln h.k. dlrs over the next two years to encourage electronics firms to send engineers for training overseas.     the engineers will learn design of application specific integrated circuits (asic) used in products ranging from personal computers to high-technology toys that talk.     the government has funded vocational training before but this will be its first such program aimed at bringing back advanced technology from overseas.     government officials told reuters that other areas in the electronics sector are being considered for similar treatment.     hong kong's key electronics industry last year accounted for exports of 61 billion h.k. dlrs, though the total includes sales of electrical machinery and other items.     officials said that this key sector, second only to textiles in terms of exports, needs high technologies already available in neighbouring economies if it is to compete.     "belatedly, we realize there are some technologies which can't be taught here," said k.y. yeung, director of industry.     a study by u.s. research firm dataquest inc last year showed that hong kong's share of u.s. consumer electronic imports had fallen to 3.5 pct in 1985 from 6.4 pct in 1983.     south korea, taiwan and japan all take a more active role in guiding economic development and policy makers are worried that perhaps some assistance -- albeit limited -- is needed.     "this is perceived to be an area of development for hong kong," said lawrence mills, director-general of the federation of hong kong industries. "many industrialists think government should be more actively concerned with this area."     hong kong likes to call its policy "positive non-intervention," meaning that it helps industry mainly by maintaining economic stability and ensuring that needed roads and harbour facilities are in place.     it offers no special tax incentives for foreign investors, believing that its low corporate profits tax of 18 pct and personal income tax of 16.5 pct are sufficient.     but the government has been forced to gradually take a more active role in the economy. in the last three years it has stepped in to aid seven problem banks, taking over three of them, to protect depositors whose funds were not insured.     it has also expanded the powers of its banking and securities commissions to police these key economic sectors.     industry officials said manufacturers need help acquiring expensive new technology, especially when returns on investment are years away. "this is only a small start but it will help make this technology more readily available," said an engineer with a major u.s. electronics firm in hong kong.     texas instruments inc txn, and motorola inc mot> of the u.s. and japan's toshiba corp tsba.t> already conduct asic design work in hong kong, while a handful of firms have committed funds for capital-intensive production.     under the industry department program, companies would be funded to train engineers overseas but those employees would be required to apply their new skills locally for an as yet unspecified period.     "we want to promote asic design and eventually production in hong kong," said yeung of the industry department.     some industrialists said it will take more than a training program to keep electronics manufacturers competitive in the years ahead. government officials said most manufacturers in the industry are small scale, employing fewer than 100 people.     these firms will not be able to afford expensive technology development programs, industry officials said.     the program has raised concerns that government may one day veer too far from its policy of minimal intervention. "they've reached the right decision," said mills of the federation of industries. "but the fear (among some firms) is it might be a slippery slope towards interference."  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>the chairman of the u.s. senate committee with jurisdiction over trade said he was concerned about a resolution on bilateral trade negotiations adopted by the canadian house of commons last week.     the resolution supports negotiation of a bilateral trading agreement with the united states while protecting canadian political sovereignty, social programs, agricultural marketing systems, the auto industry and canada's cultural identity.     senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen said the resolution may jeopardize the viability of the proposed free trade agreement between the two countries, which are each other's largest trading partners.     "we need a truly free trade agreement, which means both countries have to work toward a deal that is mutually beneficial and comprehensive, a large agreement," the texas democrat said in a statement.     "i do not question canada's right to protect its political sovereignty or cultural identity. however, if these phrases mean the government of canada means to take important economic issues off the table in these negotiations, i am deeply concerned," he added.     bentsen said canada restricts trade 15 different ways while the united states uses only six trade restriction methods. he said if canada proposes an agreement where both countries get rid of six methods of trade restriction, it would not be fair and might not win senate approval.     "i am deeply concerned that when the president visits prime minister (brian) mulroney next month, he will be presented with this kind of argument, and i hope he makes it clear -- as i did when i was in canada -- that only a mutually beneficial agreement will be successful," bentsen said.     reagan and mulroney are scheduled to meet april 5-6 in ottawa.     bentsen urged mulroney to withdraw a proposal that would ban imports of independently produced films into canada by non-canadians, which the senator called a protectionist measure.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>dollar/yen intervention responds to pressure</TITLE>
<BODY>the bank of france intervened to buy small amounts of dollars and sell yen in paris today to stabilise the exchange rates agreed at last month's meeting of finance ministers of the group of five and canada, foreign exchange dealers said.     but they said recent central bank intervention in the foreign exchange markets appeared to be a limited reaction to temporary pressures rather than a major defence operation.     a bank of france spokesman declined all comment but sources close to the central bank said it had also intervened yesterday.     dealers said the earlier intervention was in concert with the bundesbank and bank of japan.     the sources said the french central bank could have been in the market again today in two-way operations, not necessarily on its own account, but to counter short-term pressures arising from the end of the japanese financial year on march 31.     one major french bank said it bought between five and 15 mln dlrs for the central bank and sold yen at 149.28 to the dollar.     another bank said it had been asked by the bank of france to say it was in the market, a departure from the central bank's usual insistence on confidentiality.     but other banks said they had seen no sign of intervention, which they said appeared to be on a very limited scale.     "even if 10 banks were buying five to 15 mln dlrs, you would still be talking of a small overall amount," said one dealer.     recent intervention by the bank of japan appeared mainly to have been required to meet year-end window dressing demand for yen. "this is a specific short term phenomenon rather than a wider trend," the dealer said.     operators have been extremely cautious about testing the dollar's trading ranges against the west german mark and japanese yen.     these ranges were set in february's stabilisation agreement reached here by u.s. treasury secretary james baker and the finance ministers of japan, germany, france, britain and canada.     but speculative pressures started to build again this week after baker was quoted on british television at the weekend as repeating earlier statements that washington had no target for the dollar.     baker yesterday moved to defuse speculation he was talking the dollar down, telling a cable news network interviewer and a senate committee he stood by the paris agreement. foreign exchange markets had been misreading his comments, he said.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>brazil is preparing a new economic strategy intended to protect domestic growth, finance ministry sources said.     a presidential spokesman said president jose sarney had authorised the government's economic team to prepare the new plan as soon as possible.     finance minister dilson funaro said last night the plan would reflect "an important battle to protect the country's development and keep it from recession."     funaro, who helped lead the anti-inflation cruzado plan launched in february 1986, has come under increasing attack over the past few days following the resignation of planning minister joao sayad on march 17. observers say the plan has failed to stabilise the country's economy.     sayad submitted a new package calling for a 90-day prices and a wage freeze, but met opposition from sarney and funaro.     foreign ministry sources said the new strategy was being prepared by economists persio arida and andre lara resende, both former central bank officials said to have played leading roles in the cruzado plan.    the new plan will define the terms on which brazil will seek rescheduling of its 109 billion dlr foreign debt.     on february 20, brazil suspended servicing of 70 billion dlrs of debt to private foreign banks.     funaro said last night brazil wants a rescheduling program spread over four years, and added that it had to include new loans to keep the domestic economy growing.     "in the past two years brazil paid 24 billion dlrs in servicing of its foreign debt, while only getting two billion dlrs in new loans," funaro said.   reuter </BODY>

<BODY>the price of gold bullion is likely to rise in the second half of the year on increased private investor demand, west german analysts said.     gold could rise as high as 500 dlrs per ounce later this year, said peter witte, director of westdeutsche landesbank girozentrale's trading division, after a presentation by the u.s. mint to promote its gold and silver eagle series coins.     "a lot will depend on oil prices and developments on stock exchanges," witte said, adding he saw gold positioned for further rises once it breaks out above 450 dlrs.     gold was fixed this morning in london at 411.30 dlrs.     despite current strong interest in gold mine stocks, many investors still want to buy physical gold, witte said.     interest in gold mine stocks may also wane if stock exchange rallies under way in many countries start to waver.     hermann strohmeyer, vice president of commerzbank ag's foreign exchange trading and treasury department, said gold is poised to rise to 460 to 470 dlrs an ounce in the second half of this year.     the price is unlikely to fall much below 380 or 390 dlrs an ounce, and probably will continue in a range between 380 and 430 dlrs in the first half of this year, he said.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>china will have a budget deficit of 8.017 billion yuan in calendar 1987 compared with a 7.08 billion deficit in 1986, finance minister wang bingqian said.     he told the national people's congress, the state council has decided to cut nearly all 1987 budgetary expenditures by 10 pct from the 1986 level. he said expenditures for the past two years have been inflated.     investment by localities in capital construction in 1987 must fall by 50 pct from the 1986 level and state firms must cut their losses by 30 pct, he said.     china will use 14.6 billion yuan in foreign loans in 1987, up from 7.87 billion in 1986, wang said.     it must cut back on investment in capital construction, especially construction outside the state plan, he said. funds must go into energy, transport, telecommunications, raw and semi-finished materials and not into non-production sectors.     "in view of the country's financial difficulties this year, it has been decided that seven billion yuan of the budgetary allocation for capital construction will be raised by the people's bank through loans and the issuing of bonds," he said.     wang said all localities and departments must strictly confine their 1987 capital investment to the amount set out in the state budget, a 50 pct reduction from 1986 levels.     he said that because of financial difficulties, the state cannot increase spending on culture, education, science and public health in 1987 at the same rate as over the past few years. expenditure in those sectors will rise by two pct.     the only allocations not to be affected by the general 10 pct cutback are subsidies for price rises, repayment of principal and interest on domestic and foreign loans, funds for the disabled and spending for other social relief.     wang said state firms must cut their total losses by 30 pct from the 1986 level, overhead expenses by 10 pct and raw material consumption by two pct. commercial firms must cut their deficits by 20 pct and running costs by two pct.     he said violations of financial and economic discipline are common, including tax evasion, false accounting, embezzlement, theft, extravagance and accepting and offering bribes. such practices "have reached very serious proportions in some areas, departments and units" and must be dealt with seriously, he said.     wang said 11.4 billion yuan worth of foreign loans have been arranged according to the 1986-90 plan, with 3.2 billion going to pay for foreign equipment in the baoshan steel plant near shanghai.     he said china is running no risk in using more foreign loans, provided it prepares careful feasibility studies, borrows only what it can repay and uses the loans only to develop production in priority sectors.     wang said china plans to levy new taxes on the use of arable land for non-farm purposes starting this year. half the revenue generated will go to the state and half to localities to be used in the development of agriculture.     the only new spending is 11 billion yuan to be used to cover tax reductions and increased subsidies for big and medium-size state firms and textile and other light industries. the money will also pay for increases in the state purchasing prices of some grain, cotton and oil-yielding crops, he said.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>bolivian debt buyback plan gains ground</TITLE>
<BODY>bolivia's proposal to repurchase at a deep discount the 900 mln dlrs it owes to foreign commercial banks is likely to be accepted, central bank governor javier nogales iturri said.     speaking to reporters at the annual meeting of the inter-american development bank (iadb) here, nogales said bolivia's bank advisory committee, led by bank of america, is seeking permission from creditor banks worldwide to go ahead with the scheme. more than 50 pct of the banks must give their approval, and nogales said he is confident that this threshold will be reached.     "it's working out very well, and i think we'll get clear majority," nogales said.     a senior banker working on the deal also said that banks are responding positively and said all the legal waivers necessary could be obtained within two months.     bolivia halted all payments on its commercial bank debt in march 1984. hyperinflation has been curbed and public spending trimmed, but its debt is still trading as low as 10 cts on the dollar on the secondary market and many banks have written off most, if not all, of their loans to the country.     bankers see little chance for a substantive recovery in bolivia's economic fortunes and so are willing to collect what they can on the loans.     nogales said bolivia would offer to buy back the debt at a market price. he said some banks might want to hold out for a higher price, but others would see the repurchase offer as a window of opportunity to cut their losses.     bolivia intends to pay for the repurchase with aid that foreign governments, especially the united states and west germany, are providing to help finance the eradication of coca crops. cocaine, although illegal, is bolivia's largest export.     the campaign to persuade farmers to grow legal crops instead of coca would be financed instead using local currency, nogales said.     because the fiscal deficit has been reduced to some four pct of gross domestic product, money supply could be increased to pay for the drug-eradication drive without too much of n impact on inflation, he added.     nogales said he did not expect bolivia's debt repurchase to become a model for other debtors in dire straits. "we're not seeking a universal solution," he said."               reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>uk equities seen due for downward correction</TITLE>
<BODY>the chances of u.k. stocks continuing recent rises as budget euphoria gives way to the uncertainties of a probable election are small, and market analysts say there will probably be a downwards correction in the next few weeks.     the u.k. market has managed a dizzy rise since the new year, with the ft-se index of 100 leading shares lifting 22.5 pct since january 2 to current levels around 2050.     "over the next month or two the odds are that the index will drop back to around 1,900," said john goldschmidt, head of equities research at chase manhattan securities.     "a five to 10 pct drop is likely. there was a six pct fall before the 1983 election when the conservatives were further ahead in the polls and the market was on a multiple of only 14 instead of 18 now," noted nick knight of brokers james capel.     "the old adage is "sell in may and go away'. that's likely to apply this year but will probably start in april," he added.     but few analysts believed a correction would spell the end of the bull run that has now lasted for some six years.     "as long as corporate profits and earnings keep on growing then the pressure for continued rises will be there. there seems little prospect of the growth stopping in 1987/1988," one said.     much of the recent enthusiasm has stemmed from the belief, already virtually discounted, that the ruling conservatives will call an election in the next few months - probably june - and sweep home to a third term in office.     even if this does happen, however, pre-election nerves are likely to produce the traditional effect of damping down the market until the result is clear.     "it's likely there will be one or two hiccups of confidence about the tories winning an overall majority," goldschmidt said.     "it would be quite out of character for the market to continue to sail serenely upwards right through the election and beyond," added brokers phillips and drew in a recent report.     the belief that the government itself is worried about the impact of the alliance party disrupting the usual two-corner fight of conservative and labour with unpredictable results, is not likely to give reassurance, one analyst noted.     other factors also indicate that the market is vulnerable to a downwards correction. u.k. stocks had ridden up partly on the back of record rises in new york and japan and a pause in either suggests that london would inevitably follow suit.     there would also be little new encouragement provided by general economic factors as much of the recent optimistic news, including this month's half point cut in base rates to 10 pct, is already built into prices.     "the economy is looking okay, but it can't support 20 pct increases every three months indefinitely," one said.     also, market liquidity, a powerful driving force behind the recent rises, shows signs of drying up under the pressure of the government's privatisation campaign.     the next few months will see cash calls for second tranche payments on british gas plc brgs.l, and british airways plc bab.l> as well as the proposed sale of rolls royce plc> and the as-yet untimetabled sale of the government's 31.7 pct stake in british petroleum co plc bp.l>.     on top of that, there will be calls from the gilt market even though last week's budget limited the projected 1987/88 borrowing requirement to four billion stg.     "we are looking for a squeeze on cash flow, and that's not including rights issues which have been low so far this year and may pick up in the second quarter," knight said.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>southwestern bell sbc, sees earnings dilution</TITLE>
<BODY>southwestern bell corp said that its planned acquisitions of cellular telephone and paging systems, including those of metromedia inc,, will result in some initial earnings dilution and an increase in debt ratio.     in a letter to shareholders in its 1986 annual report, the regional bell company did not indicate the degree of earnings dilution it expects from the acquisitions, which total some 1.38 billion dlrs. however, the company said the rise in its debt ratio will be temporary and will leave its debt level within an acceptable range.     in its 1986 yearend financial statement, southwestern bell listed a debt-to-equity ratio of 43.4 pct, down slightly from 43.7 pct in 1985.     in 1986, the company earned 1.02 billion dlrs, or 10.26 dlrs a share, compared with 996.2 mln dlrs, or 10 dlrs a share in 1985. revenues dipped to 7.90 billion dlrs from 7.93 billion dlrs.     southwestern bell said it expects the new tax law to have a negative impact on its cash flow, due mainly to the loss of investment tax credits.     by mid-year, however, the company said a reduced corporate tax rate should have a positive impact on its net income and cash flow.     in addition, the company said it is projecting a 1.7 pct gain in customer telephone lines and a three to four pct increase in long distance calling volumes.     southwestern bell said 1987 capital expenditures will be lower that the 1.97 billion dlrs spent in 1986, a year in which expenditures were held below budget.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>kansas city ksu, ready to buy southern pacific</TITLE>
<BODY>kansas city southern industries inc said it is ready to promptly purchase the southern pacific transportation co from santa fe southern pacific corp sfx, if the interstate commerce commission rejects sante fe's attempt to reopen the merger of southern and the atchison, tokepa and santa fe railway.     in a filing with the icc late today, the company outlined four conditions of its offer to acquire southern pacific.     among the conditions are that santa fe enter into an agreement to indemnify kansas city for any contigent liabilites of southern pacific existing as of the closing date, and that the financial condition of southern remain largely unchanged from today onward.     "we are willing, even eager, to make a fair market value offer in cash for the southern pacific," said kansas city southern president and chief executive officer landon h. rowland.     "this offer disproves the constant derogation of the sourthern pacific by sfsp management, best exemplified by sfsp chief executive john schmidt's comment in icc hearings that the southern pacific was 'bankrupt,'" said rowland.     he said that merging southern with kansas city will achieve the benefits of an end-to-end merger while preseving the independece of the southern pacific versus its existing prime competitor, santa fe.     kansas said that southern's management had estimated the value of the railroad in 1983 in the range of 281 mln dlrs to 1.2 billion dlrs.     it said that morgan stanley and co inc and salomon brothers inc, hired in 1983 to advise southern and santa fe in their merger, appraised southern as worth between 500 mln dlrs and 800 mln dlrs less than southern's own internal valuations.     kanasa city southern said it will make an offer for southern after its books, records and properties are examined.     "once that examination has been completed (and even in the absence of a willingnes of sfsp to negotiate) kcsi will make an offer in writing...." said the company.     kansas also said it argued in the icc filing that santa fe had not met the legal requirements justifying the commission's reconsideration of the proposed merger of santa fe and southern pacific, two railroads that it said basically parallel each other throughout their routes.     icc voted four to one last summer to reject the merger as inherently anticompetitive. kansas said santa fe in petitioning for reconsideration now argues that the trackage agreements with the union pacific, the denver and rio grande western and other railroads, adds to the value of the merger.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>siemens ag sieg.f, turnover in the united states will rise to about 2.6 billion dlrs in the current year to end september from 2.2 billion in 1985/86, management board chairman karlheinz kaske said.     he told the annual meeting 80 pct of last year's sales came from products made in the u.s.. he added siemens was as interested as u.s. authorities in reducing the massive trade deficit and calming down trade relations.     "but we would show no understanding if this (trade deficit reduction) was attempted through means incompatible with the principle of free world trade," kaske said.     siemens has been the subject of pressure by u.s. telecommunications authorities to limit its access to the u.s. market for digital telephone switching equipment.     the federal communications commission announced in december it was starting an enquiry into the blocking of free access to the telecommunications market by foreign firms, with officers saying reciprocal access was not available to u.s. firms abroad.     for years siemens was the only supplier of public switching stations to the bundespost, the german federal post office. regulatory authorities in 1982 opened bundespost contracts to tenders from other domestic and foreign suppliers.     but foreign authorities have complained that too many restrictions to overseas suppliers still remain.     kaske said neither siemens nor the bundespost could be held responsible for the u.s. trade deficit and noted the u.s. was still achieving substantial surpluses in trade with west germany in the electrical and telecommunications sector.     the bundespost is far more open to supplies from abroad than telephone companies in the u.s. japan or france, he added.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>cost of pik certificates to be eyed by congress</TITLE>
<BODY>congress, eager to find budget savings, launches a review of the u.s. agriculture department's generic commodity certificate program tomorrow, amid signs usda and the general accounting office, gao, are at odds over how much the program has cost u.s. taxpayers.     the gao concluded in a preliminary report last week that payment-in-kind, or pik, certificates cost between five and 20 pct more than cash outlays, administration officials who asked not to be identified said.     usda officials, however, took issue with the report, saying it did not take into account storage, handling and transport savings that accrue to the government. the gao then decided to re-examine the costs, sources said.     the issue is an important one, because congressional budget committees are known to be considering limiting the use of certificates as a means of cutting spending.     agriculture under secretary daniel amstutz and gao senior associate director brian crowley are set to testify before the senate agriculture committee tomorrow.     amstutz is expected to tell the committee that there are uncertainties in determining the cost of certificates compared to cash outlays, and that savings to the commodity credit corp, ccc, almost equal costs, department sources said.     usda estimates that it costs the government about 75 cents to store, handle and transport each bushel of commodity put in government storage.     it was unclear whether the gao, congress' investigative arm, would stick by its original analysis that it costs the government more to use certificates instead of cash in farm price and income support programs, reagan administration sources said.     the gao is expected to point out that use of payment-in-kind, pik, certificates has helped relieve tight storage by moving grain that otherwise might not have been sold.     the testimony by amstutz and gao senior associate director brian crowley comes as congressional budget committees intensify their efforts to pinpoint ways to cut the federal budget deficit -- including considering limits on the use of pik certificates.     the ccc issues dollar-denominated pik certificates, or certs, as a partial substitute for direct cash outlays to farmers or cash subsidies to exporters. certs can be used to repay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for ccc commodities or cash.     between april and december 1986, ccc issued 3.8 billion dlrs worth of certificates, according to usda. up to another 6.7 billion dlrs worth could be issued between january and august 1987, according to usda.     certs can cost the government more than cash primarily because recipients can use the certificates to pay back government loans at levels below the loan rate.     eliminating this practice, called "pik and roll," would save the government 1.4 billion dlrs between 1988-92, according to the congressional budget office, cbo. that estimate, according to a cbo official, was based on an assumption that certificates cost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments.     the senate and house budget committees are known to be considering curbs on pik-and-roll transactions among other savings alternatives.     the gao last week reached the tentative conclusion that the estimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to date have cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mln dlrs, or between five and 20 pct, more than cash outlays, one administration official said.     however, the gao has decided to reassess those estimates based in part on usda criticism, department officials said.     the broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributable to the different effect certificates can have on market prices over the course of a crop year.     usda's economic research service, for example, has found that between june and august last year, the 215 mln bushels of corn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn by between 35 and 45 cents per bushel.     between september and november, however, certificates had only a marginal impact on corn prices, according to the ers study, obtained by reuters.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>bp to offer 7.4 billion dlrs for standard shares</TITLE>
<BODY>british petroleum co plc bp.l, said it intended to make a tender offer for the 45 pct of standard oil co srd.n> it does not already own at 70 dlrs a share cash, for a total of 7.4 billion if the offer is fully accepted.     the offer would be made through its bp north america inc> unit and was intended to commence not later than april 1. the offer would not be conditional on any minimum number of shares being tendered.     bp said in a statement the 70 dlr a share price was based on its own valuation as well as those of its financial advisers. it took into account reviews of both public and non-public information.     standard closed in new york last night at 64-7/8 dlrs, down 1-3/4 dlrs.     bp shares dropped on the announcement to 877p from 888p at last night's close.     about a third of the cash payable would be met from bp's own resources.     the remainder would come from new borrowings, partly from banks under a four-year committed revolving credit facility and partly from a a new u.s. dlr commercial paper programme. the company said it was in the course of arranging these facilities.     bp chairman sir peter walters said that the group's investment in standard was its largest single asset. full ownership would enable investment and operating decisions to be made without the limitations of a minority interest.     bp also believed the acquisition represented the optimum use of its financial resources. it was confident oil prices were likely to remain within a range sufficient to justify the investment.     walters added that it also felt that, due to management changes in 1986, standard could now operate successfully even in a lower oil price environment.     standard's net assets at end-1986 were 7.02 billion dlrs and in the year it reported a loss of 1.08 billion dlrs before tax and before an extraordinary item of 608 mln dlrs.     analysts said that the move by bp had come as a surprise. one noted that it was not immediately clear why the group should spend so much money buying a company it already controlled.     bp could also have bought up the remainder of standard shares considerably cheaper had it moved six months ago.     it was also unclear what effect the tender would have on the u.k. government's recent announcement that it intended to dispose of its remaining 31.7 pct stake in bp sometime in the 1987/88 financial year, analysts said.     analyst paul spedding of brokers kleinwort grieveson noted that any effect on the government sale of its stake in bp would depend on the reaction of the markets.     the deal would probably push bp's gearing up to around 59 pct from 20 pct currently, he said.     however, with the likelihood that oil prices would not repeat last year's rapid drop the prospects for standard returning to profitability this year -- and bp benefitting from its cash flow -- were good.     standard was a high cost oil producer, the analysts noted.     spedding noted that it needed about 12 dlrs a barrel to make money, and at about 15 dlrs a barrel revenue from production and its downstream activities would push it comfortably into surplus.     bp initially took a stake in standard following the discovery of oil in alaska's prudhoe bay in 1969. bp had inadequate distribution facilities in the u.s. while standard, which was strong on marketing and refining, was short on crude oil.     the analysts said that bp had promoted a major management reorganisation of standard in the past year.     the probability that much of the shake-up at standard was now complete was one possible factor behind the timing of the tender offer, spedding said.     bp's willingness to take hard decisions such as major balance sheet write offs and the sale of assets had been well received in the markets.     the lower costs that should now be possible -- especially after the rationalisation of the loss making minerals division -- should allow the benefits of an oil price recovery to come straight through to 1987 profits without being cut back by other sectors.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>canada may monitor steel shipments</TITLE>
<BODY>canada may begin monitoring steel flowing in and out of the country to determine if any steel is being illegally "trans-shipped" to the u.s., senior government trade officials said.     the officials, asking not to be identified, said the government will investigate an industry contention that steel  imported from countries such as south korea and taiwan is being diverted to the u.s. and ultimately exasperating concerns about the level of canadian exports south of the border.     but the senior officials, asking not to be indentified, said that despite intense pressure from the reagan administration, ottawa was not considering any kind of formal limits on canadian shipments to the u.s.     "in a sense what i hope we are doing is buying some time," said one official who claimed canadian companies were "fair traders" in the big american market.     if approved by the canadian cabinet, the officials said a  monitoring system will be established in the next three or four months.     "i guess if we find trans-shipment is a problem, we would have to do something about it," said a trade official.     canadian steel shipments to the u.s. have risen to 5.7 pct of the u.s. market in recent months, almost double the level just two years ago.     the increase in canadian shipments comes at a time of growing anger in the u.s. over rising steel imports from several countries in the face of a decline among domestic steel producers.     some u.s. lawmakers have proposed canada's share of the american market be limited to 2.4 per cent.     the ontario government has urged ottawa to require foreign companies to obtain permits to import steel into the country. currently, import licences are required only for carbon or raw steel, which makes up less than half the steel market.     canada exported two billion canadian dlrs worth of steel in 1986, while importing 944-mln dlrs worth of the product in the same year.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>brazil, banks fail to make breakthrough in debt talks</TITLE>
<BODY>brazil and its bank creditors failed to achieve any breakthrough in debt talks here last night after brazil refused to say when it would resume interest payments.     central bank governor francisco gros said after a meeting with a 14-bank advisory committee that brazil cannot make any interest payments at this time, though it would do so "as soon as we can."     the talks came as the annual meeting of the 44-nation inter-american development bank (iadb), in which both gros and the bankers had been taking part, moved toward a close here.     bankers leaving the meeting with gros declined to discuss details of the talks, though some expressed satisfaction that brazil had agreed to continue working with the committee.     at the same time, gros told reporters not to expect any dramatic developments before march 31, the date when some u.s. banks have said they will take a decision whether to put brazil loans on a non-performing basis.     brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlr foreign debt to commercial banks on february 20 and shortly after announced it was freezing some 16 billion dlrs in short-term credit lines.     banks are not obliged to declare these loans non-performing before 90 days have elapsed, but the move to announce a possible decision in this respect was viewed as a means of exerting pressure on brazil.     the bank committee, headed by citibank, had been pressing brazil to make at least a token payment of interest but gros said this was not possible right now.     "we are not in a position to make a payment at this stage," gros said.     at the same time, the two sides reached a stopgap arrangement on the short-term trade and money-market credit lines, whereby the committee agreed to transmit a brazilian request to extend the lines for 60 days until may 31.     banks have been indicating they will not renew credit lines in response to the brazilian move.  reuter </BODY>

"america's interests require that agreements be honored and that u.s. industries not bear the burden for the persistent unwillingness or inability of the government of japan to deliver on its commitments," the trade group said.     the white house economic policy council is expected to discuss possible sanctions against japan at a meeting scheduled for thursday.     the trade group said japan has not lived up to the terms of the agreement last year which was aimed at ending japanese dumping of semiconductors and at opening japanese markets to foreign-based manufacturers.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>gould gld, introduces new mini supercomputers</TITLE>
<BODY>gould inc said it is introducing a new generation of very high performance mini supercomputers for intensive engineering applications.     called the npl, the mini supercomputers use gould's utx/32 operating system, which is a compatible multi-processor extension of the unix operating system consisting of complete at and t system v and berkeley bsd 4.3 environments, company officials said at a teleconference.     "the introduction of the npl family of mini supercomputers, is by far gould's most significant computer line developed to date," chairman james mcdonald said.     patrick rickard, computer systems president, said that he expects sales of npl family computers to account for 20 pct of the division's revenues for the first year after its introduction, and increase to 80 pct of revenues in five years.     computer operations accounted for one third or about 300 mln dlrs of gould's total revenues for 1986 of 908.8 mln dlrs, a company spokesman said.     the np1, the first series of the new family, uses an open systems architecture, including parallel and high speed vector processing and "massive" memory to achieve its supercomputing capability, gould officers said.     the np1 family will form the foundation for new systems which are expected to be brought to market through the 1990s, mcdonald said.     the computers are expected to have applications in science and engineering, in aerospace and defense and extend into other areas such as medical sciences, rick baron, senior director of marketing development said.     gould said it priced and packaged the np1 at a cost which will provide the power and advantages of a traditional supercomputer at a fraction of the cost.     the np1 product line includes several models priced from 395,000 dlrs to 2.9 mln dlrs, gould officials said adding that the company has already signed orders for eight np1 systems.     the low-end np1 models will be available in the 1987 third quarter and the high-end will be available in the 1988 first quarter, they said.     according to gould officials, the np1 cost 50 mln dlrs to develop and the company plans to spend between 100 to 150 mln to develop the rest of the family line. between now and 1995, the company expects to ship two to three billion dlrs of np1 mini supercomputers.     offering up to 96 mln whetstone instructions per second and 320 mln floating point operations per second, the largest of the new systems, model 480, incorporates up to four billion bytes of physical memory, they said.     the np1 family has connectability but not compatability with ibm and xerox computers, a company spokesman said.  reuter </BODY>

"we should expand production of import substitutes and increase their proportion," he said.     on exports, china should increase its proportion of manufactured goods, especially textiles, light industrial goods, electronics and machinery, he said.     zhao said china should lower the cost of exports and control the export of goods that incur too much loss. in 1986 china had a trade deficit of 11.9 billion dlrs, down from a record 14 billion in 1985.     zhao said china should work to provide a more favourable investment environment for foreign businessmen. it should use foreign funds for production and construction, with stress on firms making goods for export or import substitutes.     china should also earn more foreign exchange from tourists and contracted labour abroad, he added.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>brazilian labour unrest spreads, many banks shut</TITLE>
<BODY>brazil's labour unrest is spreading, with many banks, universities and government statistical offices on strike and more pay disputes looming.     bankworkers' leaders said that a national strike launched yesterday to press for a 100 pct immediate pay rise and monthly salary adjustments had the support of most of the 700,000 workforce.     the strike today closed the stock exchanges of sao paulo and rio de janeiro.     for the government the one positive development on the labour front was the gradual return to work of the nation's 40,000 seamen, who began a national strike on february 27.     a union spokesman in rio de janeiro told reuters about half the seamen had returned to work after accords with 22 companies and that the strike looked close to an end.     otherwise the labour scene looked bleak, with the bank strike posing the most serious problems for brazil's crisis-laden economy.     "if this goes on for more than a few days it will have a serious effect because normal financial operations will grind to a halt," said a western diplomat in sao paulo.     today brazil's 50,000 university teachers in the 42 federal universities launched a national strike, with a broad political demand as well as a pay claim.     david fleischer, head of the political science department in brasilia university, told reuters the national association of higher education teachers wanted a full congressional inquiry into what had happened to government education funds.     he said the universities were strapped for cash and that the association suspected the junior partner in the coalition government, the liberal front party, pfl, of using education funds for projects which had helped their candidates in elections. the pfl holds the education ministry.     hardly any sectors of the economy are proving immune to the current labour unrest, caused by the return of high inflation, officially pegged at 33 pct for january-february.     other possible strikes looming include stoppages by oil industry workers and social security workers.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>amsterdam exchange announces modernisation drive</TITLE>
<BODY>the amsterdam stock exchange, engaged in a reform program to boost competitiveness, said it is launching a modernisation drive of its operational systems.     the move, announced one day after news of a first step toward integration of financial market supervision in the netherlands, will involve new transaction and clearing and settlement systems.     in addition, the bourse's amsterdam interprofessional market (aim) information system will be updated in short term with software provided by the chicago midwest stock exchange.     the amsterdam bourse is also studying the possible acquisition of midwest exchange software for a new order-routing system, a statement said, noting the market here remains firmly committed to the preservation of a trading floor.     "the bourse management feels that, despite the discussions triggered by the intended closure of the trading floor in london, preparations for an overhaul of the trading floor in amsterdam have to continue," the statement said.     the operational modernisation of the amsterdam stock exchange follows several liberalisation measures aimed at stemming the flow of business to markets abroad.     the liberalisation, particularly the introduction of off-floor trading in stocks and bonds on a net-basis under the aim system, has been described by bourse officials as amsterdam's "little bang," a reference to sweeping reforms last october on the london stock exchange known as big bang.     aim, started in a trial run early last year and officially in force from january 1 this year, is already credited with halting the growth in dutch stocks traded abroad, mainly london.     amsterdam, which feels an on-floor facility with fees is vital for smaller investors, said it needs to overhaul the floor to accommodate new technology and new members.     a new floor layout and order-routing system should be ready sometime next year, the statement said.     it said it was also planning a new on-screen central securities information system with prices from international exchanges, including the u.s. and japan, stock information and company news.     yesterday, the bourse announced it would start coordinating this summer market supervision with the options and futures trade in the netherlands as a first step toward a unified financial markets watchdog. in addition, the bourse, options and gold futures price lists will be merged this april.     transactions in amsterdam are still processed with a now outdated punch card system while price information stemming from the larger off-floor deals done through aim are not yet integrated in the bourse's big board.     a bourse spokesman said the exchange hoped to launch its screen information service by 1989, but added this service did not have first priority.     at present, bourse price information and company information announced by the bourse are published by a printer service while a select number of prices is available via teletext.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>german current account surplus widens in february</TITLE>
<BODY>west germany's current account surplus widened to a provisional 6.6 billion marks in february from a slightly downwards revised 4.8 billion in january, a spokeswoman for the federal statistics office said.     the trade surplus in february widened to a provisional 10.4 billion marks from 7.2 billion in january, she added.     the statistics office had originally put the january current account surplus at 4.9 billion marks.     the february trade surplus was well up on the 6.84 billion mark surplus posted in the same month of 1986. but the current account surplus was down slightly from the 6.85 billion surplus recorded in february 1986.     a statistics office statement said the widening of the february current account surplus compared with january was due to seasonal factors. neither the trade nor current account figures are seasonally adjusted.     february imports, measured in terms of value, totalled 32.11 billion marks, a decline of 10 pct against february 1986 but a rise of 5.5 pct against january.     exports in february, also in value terms, totalled 42.56 billion marks, 0.5 pct less than in february 1986 but up 13 pct compared with january.     the statistics office said it was not yet able to calculate the real change in exports and imports in february. but for comparison purposes it noted that in january the average value of imports had fallen 15 pct year-on-year while the average value of exports had declined by only 4.4 pct.     within the current account, the services account had 300 mln marks deficit, supplementary trade items a 200 mln mark surplus while transfer payments posted a 3.7 billion mark deficit.     taking the first two months of 1987 together, imports in value terms fell 14 pct to 62.6 billion marks compared with a year earlier. the value of exports totalled 80.2 billion marks, a decline of 7.4 pct against the same months of 1986.     the resulting trade surplus of 17.6 billion marks for january/february compares with a cumulative surplus of 14.1 billion marks in the year-ago period.     the cumulative current account surplus for january and february 1987 totalled 11.3 billion marks against 11.4 billion marks a year earlier, the statistics office said.     bank economists said the rise in the february trade surplus reflected an improvement in the terms of trade as well as seasonal factors. the federal statistics office said earlier this week that february import prices fell 0.7 pct against january while export prices were unchanged.     "the rise in the nominal figures masks a lower export trend that is not expected to change for several months at least," said an economist. he said the nominal trade surplus for 1987 as a whole is likely to fall only slightly from the record 112.2 billion marks in 1986 but other economists said the surplus could fall to around 80 billion marks.     an economist at the bank fuer gemeinwirtschaft (bfg) in frankfurt said a two-month comparison of trade figures gave a more accurate picture of west germany's trade position.     he noted the 17.6 billion mark surplus for january and february together was lower than the 21.6 billion mark surplus posted in november and december.     "the trend is clearly lower," he said.     this economist, who declined to be named, said the february rise was also partly explained by special factors in january, when there had been a number of public holidays as well as extremely cold weather, both of which hindered trade.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>u.s. legislation could bar japanese dealers</TITLE>
<BODY>the house banking committee approved legislation to bar foreign securities firms from designation as primary dealers in u.s. government securities unless the relevant foreign government allows u.s. securities firms the same trading rights.     the impact of the proposed legislation would be on three japanese securities firms already doing business in the u.s., an aide to the sponsor of the provision rep. charles schumer said. japan would have six months to open its government securities markets to u.s. firms before the ban would start. other foreign firms would meet the test of reciprocal access.     the legislation was approved as part of a major trade bill, which the house will consider next month. the bill also has to be considered by the senate and signed by the president.     the three japanese firms are nomura securities co. and daiwa securities co., which received approval from the u.s. federal reserve board to serve as primary dealers, and aubrey g. lanston co., owned by the industrial bank of japan.     schumer, a new york democrat, said the fed would not be allowed to designate any new firms as primary dealers unless their government allows reciprocal access to u.s. companies. both the house and senate banking committees opposed the fed action on the two japanese firms.  reuter </BODY>

"to date, pennzoil has yet to receive any meaningful settlement offer from texaco, though it remains open to any realistic effort to settle the matter," pennzoil chairman hugh liedtke said in the annual report.     pennzoil also said it had budgeted 212 mln dlrs for capital spending in 1987, a drop from the 233 mln dlrs spent last year.     proved u.s. and foreign reserves of natural gas declined to 964 billion cubic feet last year, from 1.01 trillion cubic feet in 1985, because of a virtual halt in its exploration program, pennzoil said. its crude oil reserves dropped to 140 mln barrels from 158 mln barrels in 1985.      the houston-based company said it sold an average of 339 mln cubic feet of domestic natural gas each day last year, a 17 pct drop from 1985. the average sales price for gas dropped by 60 cents per mcf to 2.16 dlrs per mcf, pennzoil said.     u.s. crude oil and gas liquids production last year fell to an average of 33,290 barrels per day from 34,102 barrels per day in 1985.     the company's total revenues in 1986 declined to 482.3 mln dlrs, from 762.5 mln dlrs the previous year. operating income in 1986 fell more than 80 pct, to 38.0 mln dlrs.     pennzoil said its goals for 1987 included development of its point arguello oilfield off the california coast, to maintain current production levels in its bluebell-altamont field in utah and to drill for prospects in the gulf of mexico's mobile bay area.     "production should begin late in the year from the harvest platform in the santa maria basin offshore california," the company said. "pennzoil's share of this production initially should be five thousand barrels a day, increasing to a peak of 15 thousand barrels a day, net, by 1989."     in its sulphur business, pennzoil said production totaled 2.1 mln long tons last year, a decline of 18 pct from 1985. the average sales price also declined, to 138.25 dlrs per long ton from 141.05 dlrs in 1985.     "the long term outlook for our sulphur operations remains bright," the company said.

<BODY>australia's largest company, the broken hill pty co ltd brkn.s, (bhp), is expected to report a net profit of around 600 mln to 620 mln dlrs tomorrow for the first nine months ended february 28, share analysts polled by reuters said.     this would be well below the 813.0 mln dlrs earned in the first three quarters of 1985/86. in the full year ended may 31 1986 the group earned a record 988.2 mln dlrs.     the analysts estimated that the group would report a third quarter net in the region of 200 mln to 220 mln dlrs, against 238.6 mln a year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter.     bhp's earnings in the first half ended november 30 amounted to 397.0 mln dlrs, sharply down from 589.3 mln a year earlier.     the analysts predicted that bhp will report an upturn in petroleum earnings compared with the first quarter, reflecting some improvement in crude oil prices from the bass strait fields, but these gains would be offset by lower mineral and steel earnings.     they said the mineral group has been hit by lower coal prices and shipments to japan while the steel division has been affected by industrial and production problems.     the analysts noted that the third quarter is normally bhp's lowest-earning period owing to a number of seasonal factors, and they predicted a sharp rise in fourth quarter net to around 300 mln dlrs.     one key factor in the fourth quarter is expected to be a tax break of some 70 mln dlrs for the investment allowance on capital expenditure in the steel division, they said.     they said they saw bhp's full year earnings at around 900 mln to 920 mln dlrs. they added that such a decline from 1985/86 would be no surprise, noting bhp has said that it would be difficult to equal its record 1985/86 net profit.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>south africa problems remain despite debt pact</TITLE>
<BODY>south africa's new foreign debt agreement sparked a rally in local financial markets, but bankers and economists said the pact removes only one source of anxiety from a still depressed economy.     "we have not gone from 'no confidence' to 'full confidence' yet," commented one banker, who saw the agreement as having marginal influence on fundamental economic problems.     money market analysts cited the debt renegotiation as the main impetus behind increases today in both the commercial and financial rand.     the commercial rand, used for current account transactions, rose 0.5 cts to 49 u.s. cts while the financial rand jumped nearly two cts to 33 u.s. cts.     all equity and fixed investment flows of foreigners take place through the financial rand, which is considered the main barometer of south africa's attractiveness to overseas investors.     analysts predicted the debt arrangement plus further gains in the gold price could push the commercial rand over 50 u.s. cts and the financial rand to 35 cents in the next few weeks.     they said the financial rand in particular was being driven by a tentative provision in the new debt agreement that could favorably affect the currency.     foreign creditors may get permission to convert loan balances and short-term claims into equity investments in south africa.     finance minister barend du plessis said the reserve bank was "investigating the implications of such conversions in light of terms and restrictions of the financial rand system."     du plessis in disclosing the new agreement last night said the recent sharp rise in the financial rand was an example that "some foreign investors are again taking a more realistic view of south africa."     terms of the debt agreement call for south africa to repay 1.42 billion dlrs of 13 billion dlrs of frozen debt over the next three years. the agreement extends a standstill arrangement, expiring june 30, that has been in place since august, 1985.     bankers said the repayment amounts essentially confirmed their private estimates and could be comfortably met by the monetary authorities.     "they (creditors) asked for the maximum amount and we offered the minimum," said one banking source, reacting to reports from london that creditors were hoping for larger repayments.     reserve bank governor gerhard de kock said south africa should have "no difficulty whatsoever" with the terms.     economists said the debt agreement would have no significant impact on economic problems continuing to face south africa including high rates of inflation and unemployment, labour unrest and political uncertainty.     johannesburg stock exchange president tony norton, speaking yesterday before the debt agreement, said the economy was "in bad shape" and there was "an awful lot of talk but little action" to cure serious problems.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>swire pacific ltd swpc.hkg, expects continued growth in all divisions this year though it sees problems in the marine sector, chairman michael miles said.     he told reporters:"1987 has started well for cathay pacific airways which looks forward to another good year... swire properties expects further good results both from properties under development for sale and from its investment property portfolio."     he did not give any specific projections for earnings. the company earlier reported 46 pct higher 1986 net profits at 1.78 billion h.k. dlrs from a year ago.     swire also had an extraordinary profit of 1.38 billion dlrs mainly from the sale of a 15.25 pct interest in cathay pacific airways ltd caph.hkg>.     miles said the company will use the money to develop its business, primarily in hong kong.     swire's stake in cathay was first reduced to 54.25 pct from 70 pct when cathay was publicly floated, and then cut to 50.25 pct when cathay issued new shares amounting to 12 pct of the enlarged capital to the state-owned china international trust and investment corp>. cathay last week reported its 1986 profits rose to 1.23 billion dlrs from 777 mln a year ago.     miles said despite last year's rapid expansion in cathay's flights and fleet, load factor is still holding up at 70 pct.     he said cathay's growth last year was the result of "a marginal increase in the revenue load factor coupled with savings in fuel costs."     "at present fuel prices are stable and will remain stable for the rest of this year," he said, "though there might be a bit of increase later this year.''     miles said swire is not abandoning its offshore oil service operations, even though the marine sector is generally depressed. "obviously the marine industry is not getting any better," he said.     the real estate market remained strong and swire last year revalued its property portfolio up 634 mln dlrs compared with an increase of 864.4 mln dlrs the previous year.     miles said he expects the property market to remain firm but said the firm has no available land for a major housing project such as its taikoo shing development on hong kong island now near completion.     he said the company's 50 pct unit hongkong united dockyard ltd> is negotiating with the government for the development of an existing petroleum storage depot into a major housing estate. "but it's not as big as taikoo shing," he said.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>british banks resist signing mexico package</TITLE>
<BODY>british banks are resisting signing a 76 billion dlr rescheduling package for mexico in a last ditch effort to get all participants to contribute equally to a new 7.7 billion dlr loan contained in the package.     christopher brougham, regional manager, rescheduling unit, at lloyds bank plc, said in response to a reuter enquiry, that the six major u.k. clearing banks last week sent a telex to citibank saying they would contribute what was requested provided all other major lenders did the same and that the u.s. banks contribute at least 90 pct of the amount required by them.     other bankers, who declined to be identified, said other groups of banks particularly those in switzerland, france and canada, were equally reluctant to sign, although they had not sent any telex to citibank, which chairs mexico's 13-bank advisory group.     however, they said it was likely that if and when the british banks sign the accord, the others are likely to follow.     under the agreement, for which the signing began on friday, commercial banks are being asked to contribute 12.9 pct of their exposure to mexico as of august 1982. that was the date of the first mexican debt crisis.     after months of haggling, a proposed rescheduling agreement for mexico was struck last september during the annual meeting of the world bank and international monetary fund in washington.     ever since then the advisory group, of which lloyds is a member, has been attempting to round up the needed signatories.     however, there has been considerable resistance to the package, partly because of some of the clauses it contains and partly because many small u.s. regional banks do not want to increase their exposure to any latin american countries.     brougham said, "we (british banks) have always played along for mexico and will do so as long as others share equally."     the decision to send the telexes was agreed on by the six clearers jointly, but each sent its own telex.     in addition to lloyds, telexes were sent by national westminster bank plc, barclays bank plc, midland bank plc, tandard chartered bank plc and royal bank of scotland plc.     brougham noted that so far the u.s. banks have only reached 83-1/2 pct of the total that is expected from them, while the level of contributions from the u.k. banks is well in excess of 90 pct. "the u.s. figure should be closer to ours," he said.     many bankers have been angered by the resistance of the regional u.s. banks, noting that even if they don't contribute to the new loan they still will be receiving interest on the existing loans.     the banks still have three weeks to sign the agreement and bankers are hoping all will go according to plan.     in the meantime, bankers expect further pressure will be exercised on the regional banks and the major u.s. banks to find a solution to the problem. many have suggested that the larger u.s. banks should take on the additional obligations, but so far they have resisted this.     bankers expect that much of the pressure on the u.s. banks will come from u.s. regulators, notably the federal reserve.     bankers prefer to view the stance taken by the british banks and other national groups as "a matter of principal, and burden sharing" rather than as a "pressure tactic" to force the u.s. banks to make up their share.     the bankers are not the only ones to be upset by the protracted negotiations surrounding the agreement.     the mexicans themselves have been angered by the delays. at the signing in new york last friday, finance minister gustavo petricioli sounded a warning to the recalcitrant banks.     "those who supported us today can be sure that mexico will continue to be open and willing to share with them the business opportunities which its future growth will create," petricioli said.     conversion of bank debt into equity investments in mexico is one option banks can take advantage of to reduce their exposure. but mexico halted its debt for equity program in february in an effort to concentrate on finalising the package.     on friday, petricioli said "we will be a lot more expeditious in processing the requests of banks that have supported us."     the pressure on the u.s. banks comes at a time when other major latin american debtors are in the process of crucial debt negotiations.     brazil, the third world's largest debtor, has suspended all interest payments on its 109 billion dlrs of foreign debt. many of the major u.s. banks, including citibank, have already said they might have to put their brazil loans on a cash basis and take the financial losses, which could total billions of dollars.     this would be required by u.s. banking regulations if the interest payments are more than 90 days overdue.     however, the u.s. banks are not the only ones threatened by regulations. in the u.k., a proposed inland revenue ruling would affect the tax treatment of certain types of loans, many of which are made to latin american countries.     basically, the ruling wants to limit the tax credit a bank can claim for tax withheld by foreign governments on loan interest payments.     the british banks are planning to fight the proposals as their implementation could prove extremely costly, not just in terms of compliance but in limiting future business.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>bat shares undervalued, say stock market analysts</TITLE>
<BODY>bat industries plc bti.l, 1986 results, which were at the upper end of market expectations, showed the company was in a strong position and that its shares were probably undervalued, share analysts said.     bat shares were down at 524p in late afternoon trading after a previous 535p close. they touched a high of 538p earlier on news of a 19 pct rise in annual profits to 1.39 billion pre-tax.     stock market analysts said today's generally weak stock market plus unwinding of positions after heavy buying of bat shares in the run-up to the results caused the fall in the share price.     "in the current market, people almost expect companies to beat expectations," said one analyst, adding that pretax profits of 1.35 to 1.40 billion stg had been forecast.     bat's 1986 figure of 1.39 billion stg compared with a 1985 pretax profit of 1.17 billion.     brokers noted that bat's shift away from its underperforming industries and the decreasing share of the tobacco portion of the group were seen as good signs.     bat chairman patrick sheehy told a news conference that the tobacco sector of the company had declined to 50 pct from 74 pct four years ago.     sheehy said he could see the tobacco portion of the company declining further as other sectors increased in importance.     he said bat was looking to expand in the area of financial services, in particular in the u.s.     sheehy also said the group had "no sizeable acquisitions" in sight in the near future.     analysts said bat's increasingly good performance in the u.k. insurance area was encouraging.     its declining debt-to-equity ratio of currently about 16 pct also made it likely that bat would soon be looking to make major acquisitions, they said.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>u.s. tax fraud charges brought against three</TITLE>
<BODY>three men were charged today with operating a large tax fraud scheme that provided more than 500 mln dlrs in phony tax losses for many prominent people, including cbs inc. cbs, president laurence tisch and his brother preston, who is president reagan's postmaster general.     the indictment was handed down by a federal grand jury to in new york.     the three indicted were named as charles atkins, william hack and ernest grunebaum, all well-known promoters of tax shelters. atkins was well-known as an organizer of tax shelters in the late 1970s and early 1980.     the indictment said that between 1978 and 1983, the defendants conspired to defraud the government by arranging "rigged and fraudulent" transactions in governmenmt securities and false tax deductions based on phony trading losses and interest expenses.     more than 350 mln dlrs in false deductions were passed on to partners in three tax shelters.     in addition, the defendants sold over 200 mln dlrs in phony trading losses and interest expenses to other entities and individuals to be used as tax deductions.     the indictment said that over 1.1 billion dlrs in trading losses and interest expenses were generated by the scheme but were off-set by "fictious gains."     laurence tisch was said by the indictment to have reported a net loss of 1.1 mln dlrs. his brother, preston tisch, reported a loss of 480,000 dlrs.     none of the three men's clients were charged with any criminal acts. but should the three be found guilty, their clients will be required to pay taxes they originally avoided through the tax shelter scheme, plus interest and possibly penalties.   reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>middle east currency market sees key changes</TITLE>
<BODY>middle east currency dealers meet in abu dhabi this weekend at a time of fundamental change in their business, which has seen a growing volume of trade shift from the arab world to london.     the 14th congress of the inter-arab cambiste association also comes at a time when the prospect of a unified gulf currency system is more real that at any time this decade.     foreign exchange traders and bank treasurers said these issues, and the slide of the lebanese pound, can be expected to be major talking points.     about 250 traders and treasurers from some 115 banks -- including some in london and other major non-arab financial centres -- are expected to attend the conference which begins on on saturday.     bankers said it is hard to avoid the impression that a growing proportion of transactions in the saudi riyal market, by far the largest in the region, is being carried out in london.     the market had been dominated by saudi arabia's 11 banks, foreign exchange houses in the kingdom and offshore banks in bahrain. but bankers said more and more saudi and bahrain-based banks are boosting their treasury operations in london.     as recession hit the middle east and the need for trade finance in the region declined, many offshore banks in bahrain ran down their currency operations. none of the four major u.k. clearing banks now has a dealing room on the island.     the two major bahrain-based international banks, arab banking corp, and gulf international bank bsc> have increased their presence in london and saudi banks are busy upgrading representative offices to branch status to allow dealing.     one economist said: "it is cheaper to run a riyal book in london than staff an expensive offshore operation in bahrain... there is now the nucleus of a two-way market in london."     jeddah-based riyad bank> set up as a licensed deposit taker in london in 1984, while its main rival in saudi arabia, national commercial bank> (ncb) won a licence in november 1986.     the major market maker has traditionally been london-based consortium bank saudi international bank> but the kingdom joint-venture saudi american bank> (samba) also upgraded its london operation to deposit taker status in mid-february.     one senior currency trader in riyadh said: "inevitably the volume of business in london has gained pace with the two new licences for ncb and samba, but there is no question that most of the liquidity still rests in saudi arabia."     currency traders said the shift to london in the saudi riyal market is difficult to quantify.     bahrain monetary agency figures show regional currency deposits held by offshore banks, most in saudi riyals, dropped to the equivalent of 12.2 billion dlrs at end-september 1986 from 13.4 billion at end-1985 and a 1983 peak of 15.0 billion.     the shift has prompted changes in dealing habits. riyal trading in the gulf on saturdays and sundays has become very quiet with london closed while some saudi and bahrain banks now staff offices on friday, the gulf weekend. traders also expect arab national bank> to step up london operations.     traders say it is difficult to foresee the riyal market moving completely out of the region, partly because of local demand and partly because of what is seen as the saudi arabian monetary agency's (sama) desire to moderate internationalisation of the riyal and protect it from undue speculation.     there have been far fewer signs of the kuwaiti dinar market shifting from its natural base of kuwait and trading in bahrain and london is still limited.     but for the first time since the formation of the six nation gulf cooperation council (gcc) in 1981 there are signs that a much mooted currency union could come into force soon.     currency traders said it remains unclear what form a final currency union would take for the six states -- saudi arabia, kuwait, bahrain, oman, qatar and the united arab emirates.     but plans to link the six currencies in a european monetary system style with a common peg have been discussed at high level and could be a topic on the gcc's annual summit expected to be held in saudi arabia late in the year.     one dealer said: "a lot of exposure is being given to discussions and plans appear to be quite advanced. but in the end a political decision has to be taken to give the go-ahead."     one open question is that of a common peg for currencies.     the idea of linking the six currencies has been debated since the start of the gcc. the kuwaiti dinar is currently linked to a basket of currencies while the other five currencies are either officially or in practice linked to the u.s. dollar.     some traders said a currency union could mean speculation against the saudi riyal rubbing off on other gulf currencies, but plans call for a permitted divergence in the system of 7-1/4 pct, large enough to avoid sudden strains.     another topic for debate is expected to be the continued slide of the lebanese pound against the dollar and the undermining of the effective capital base of lebanese banks.  reuter </BODY>

"the prices of farm products, energy, raw and semi-finished materials and other primary products have long been too low and many products have long been in short supply," he said.     price reforms are necessary to "establish a new vigorous socialist economic structure, to effectively promote production and commodity circulation and provide correct guidance to consumption," zhao added.     reforms are bound to lead to a rise in the general price level but will only be implemented after careful studies so as to keep the increase within the capacity of society and the people "to withstand the strain."      he said the general price level will rise in 1987 less than in 1986, with price increases of a very small number of products.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>a leading member of britain's opposition labour party said there was strong evidence prime minister margaret thatcher approved the sale of anti- aircraft missiles to nicaraguan contra rebels during talks last year with u.s. officials involved in the iran arms scandal.     labour foreign affairs spokesman george foulkes told parliament the u.s. tower commission report on the sale of arms to iran showed colonel oliver north had tried to obtain 20 blowpipe missiles and 10 launchers through a south american country from a belfast-based company, short brothers, which manufactures the missiles.     short brothers is owned by the british government.     junior foreign officer minister timothy eggar dismissed the claims as "wild and fanciful allegations" with no foundation.     foulkes said north testified he was seeking the help of "a head of an allied government" in obtaining the blowpipes and suggested the supply of missiles was discussed during two meetings which he said took place between north, the then head of the cia william casey and thatcher in 1986.     "we need to know what happened at those meetings between mr casey, colonel north and the prime minister last year. what were they talking about if it were not the supply of blowpipe missiles to the contra terrorists?" foulkes said.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>thatcher defends uk oil policy in saudi interview</TITLE>
<BODY>british prime minister margaret thatcher denied in an interview published in saudi arabia today that her government's oil policy contributed to weakness in world oil prices.     she said the government was determined not to intervene to influence production decisions by oil companies operating in the north sea.     "we believe these must be a matter for the commercial judgment of the oil companies," she told the arabic language daily al-sharq al-awsat in an interview coinciding with a visit to london by king fahd of saudi arabia.     thatcher said this policy had not contributed to the fall in oil prices as north sea production was now about the same as in 1984 when prices were close to 30 dlrs a barrel.     british production was on a plateau and was unlikely to increase in the future, she said.     "we naturally share the concern of saudi arabia and other opec members about the harmful effects of oil market volatility for both producer and consumer countries," thatcher said.     "on our part, we are careful to avoid any actions which might add to such volatility."  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>brazil asks 60-day extension short-term credit</TITLE>
<BODY>brazil today suggested to its foreign bank creditors an extension of short-term credit lines for 60 days until may 31, a spokesman for the central bank said.     he said that with the move, called a "standstill" arrangement, brazil was only trying to avoid difficulties to pay its 109 billion dlrs debt in the future.     the spokesman told reuters that brazil's suggestion will be communicated by telex to brazil's 700 bank creditors.     the spokesman declined to give details of what was included in the statement, but said central bank president francisco gros was seeking a 60-day extension of the short-term credit lines from its commercial bank creditors.     the amount of these credit lines totals 15 billion dollars, and deadline for payment is set for march 31.     finance minister dilson funaro said in a television interview it was "absolutely important" for brazil and its creditors to renew the short-term credit lines, as brazil must finance its exports.     "if these credit lines were cut, we would face difficulties to honour our foreign debt in the future," funaro said.     "there is evidently a common interest in the matter," he said.     funaro said, however, he was told creditors understand brazil's position and do not wish to turn the negotiation for the renewal of the credit lines more difficult.     brazil last month suspended interest payments on its 68- billion dlrs debt to commercial banks and froze short-term trade and money market lines.     he said brazil's suggestion is part of its demands "before the need to renew the mechanisms of loans in the world."     funaro said currently debt negotiations are "very complex and complicated," mentioning cases of countries which had to wait some 10 months before getting a reply from creditors.     "we are not interested in confrontation, but we would like the loan mechanisms to show that the crisis belongs to both sides," funaro said.     funaro denied rumours that he had offered his resignation to president jose sarney.     "who decides whether to keep or dismiss his ministers is the president. everything else is nothing but speculation," he said.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>yen may rise to 140 to the dollar, nikkeiren says</TITLE>
<BODY>the yen could rise to 140 yen to the dollar, a leading japanese businessman said.     bumpei otsuki, president of the influential japan federation of employers' associations, (nikkeiren), told reporters: "the yen might rise as far as 140 (to the dollar). the u.s. economy is not good, and as long as the u.s. economy is not good, the u.s. will put various pressures (on japan)."     "the yen's level depends on the condition of the u.s. economy rather than japan's economy, and as long as the american situation is bad, the yen will continue to rise," he said.     to cope with the negative impact of the strong yen, japanese enterprises must strive to cut costs by all means, including holding down wages as much as possible, otsuki said.     he rejected recent calls from some government quarters for wage increases this year as a means of raising private consumption and thus boosting domestic demand.     "we have to keep wages as low as possible," he said.     he also said the yen's large and rapid rise is depressing the outlook for the japanese economy, noting that in addition to hurting exporters it is also damaging domestic market manufacturers through cheap imports.     parts of the service sector are also threatened, otsuki said.     tertiary industries provide services to manufacturers and a downturn in manufacturing profits will adversely affect service industries, he said.     it is also doubtful whether the tertiary sector can fully employ those put out of work in the manufacturing sector, he said.     profits of service sector companies are likely to fall in the business year ending in march 1988, leading to a possible recession in the japanese economy, he said.     otsuki said economic growth is unlikely to pick up beyond levels experienced in 1986.     the government's economic planning agency said last week the economy grew at 2.5 pct in 1986, the worst performance since 1974 when the economy shrank 1.4 pct due to the first oil price crisis.     in order to stimulate domestic demand and boost the economy, tax reforms aimed at bringing down the cost of land and reforming the nation's housing stock are needed, along with steps to bring down the high cost of commodities, he said.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>talking point/tobacco stocks</TITLE>
<BODY>stocks of tobacco companies rose sharply as investors grew more confident that an excise tax would not be imposed on tobacco, traders and analysts said.     they also said the stocks are relatively inexpensive since fear of the tax and of pending litigation regarding warning labels for tobacco products have kept many investors away recently.     philip morris cos mo, rose 2-5/8 to 87-3/4, rjr nabisco rjr> 1-1/4 to 57-1/2 and u.s. tobacco ubo> 7/8 to 27.     "the near-term activity of these stocks has been dominated by external factors such as smoking restriction legislation, concern over liability suits and the possible imposition of excise taxes," dean witter analyst lawrence adelman said. "but the feeling is that many of those externals have been discounted in the price of the stocks."     adelman, who issued a positive recommendation on philip morris earlier this week, said there have been indications that the reagan administration's staunch opposition to tax hikes would short-circuit attempts to tax tobacco.     "the tobaccos do have more risks than regular consumer stocks because of these external factors," adelman said. "they are not for the weak-hearted, but they offer a lot of value for the aggressive investor."     in a market where everyone is looking for affordable stocks, trader drew schaefer of kidder peabody said, it is not hard to understand why the tobaccos, which have been depressed for a while in a positive market, are attracting buyers.     adelman believes one of the better buys is philip morris. "it is a powerhouse of potential growth in earnings, dividends and free cash flow. and the stock is cheap now," he said.     adelman expects morris to earn eight dlrs a share this year compared to 6.20 dlrs a share earned a year ago. in 1988, the company should report a profit 10.30 dlrs a share.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>guyana finance minister optimistic but seeks help</TITLE>
<BODY>guyana hopes to overcome its financial problems within three to five years and is now seeking help from donor governments, finance minister carl greenidge said.     he said guyana took its problems in january to the caribbean group for cooperation and development, which includes governments and multilateral agencies, with a view to finding a long-term recovery plan.     guyana's arrears to the international monetary fund (imf) are now 70 mln dlrs and it would not be eligible for new loans in the near future, greenidge told reuters during the inter-american development bank (iadb) annual meeting here. more     greenidge also said a world bank mission would visit georgetown this week to assess prospects for a rescue plan that would enable guyana to revive its economy. but he said the government does not expect to be able to reduce its arrears this year.     arrears to the imf and the world bank are projected to rise to 100 mln dlrs by the end of 1987. about 90 mln dlrs of this, equivalent to nearly half guyana's annual exports, would be owed to the imf.     "expecting us to pay arrears is like asking a dying man to give a pint of blood," greenidge said.     but greenidge said guyana has taken steps to reduce its fiscal deficit, which now amounts to 65 pct of gdp. it has increased taxes, reduced public expenditure and refinanced its internal debt.     he said the world bank would meanwhile look at investment requirements for potential export-earning projects such as gold mining, timber, oil and kaolin.     because of its arrears, guyana has been unable to draw down a 40 mln dlr world bank loan for a bauxite industry rehabilitation project. bauxite accounts for 90 mln dlrs of exports, or 40 pct of the total.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>baker says he stands by paris currency agreement</TITLE>
<BODY>treasury secretary james baker said he stood by the paris agreement among leading industrial nations to foster exchange rate stability around current levels.     "i would refer you to the paris agreement which was a recognition the currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals," baker told the cable news network in an interview.     "we were quite satisfied with the agreement in paris otherwise we would not have been a party too it," he said.     baker also noted the nations agreed in the accord to "co-operate to foster greater exchange rate stability around those levels."     he refused to comment directly on the current yen/dollar rate but said flatly that foreign exchange markets recently tended "to draw unwarranted inferences from what i say."     baker was quoted on british television over the weekend as saying he has no target for the u.s. currency, a statement that triggered this week's renewed decline of the dollar.     "i think the paris agreement represents evidence that international economic policy co-ordination is alive and well," baker said.     the treasury secretary stressed however it was very important for the main surplus countries to grow as fast as they could consistent with low inflation to resolve trade imbalances.     he added that federal reserve board chairman paul volcker has also "been very outspoken" in suggesting main trading partners grow as fast as they can.     baker noted that the j-curve, the delayed beneficial effect of a weakening of a currency on that country's trade balance, takes 12 to 18 months to work its way through to the trade deficit and it is now 18 months since the plaza agreement to lower the dollar's value.     he also said improvements in the trade deficit should come from other sources besides the exchange rate, and pointed out the administration's package to improve u.s. competitiveness was now before congress.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>sri lankan government to stop importing sugar</TITLE>
<BODY>the food department will no longer import sugar from april 1, senior officials of the food and cooperatives ministry and the department told reuters.     they said the decision was taken after the sugar importers association asked that the sugar trade be further liberalised.     "the food department will cease trading in sugar and will no longer hold a buffer stock," a senior official said.     he said the government has finalised an agreement with e.d.f.man (sugar) ltd under which e.d.f.man will hold a buffer stock on the government's behalf of 20,000 tonnes, against the 45,000 tonne buffer stock usually held by the department.     officials said the size of the buffer stock has been reduced because the private sector will hold its own stocks.     the agreement with e.d.f. man includes details such as trigger pricing mechanisms, they said.     four months ago the department allowed the private sector to import sugar without government clearance. the department and the private sector each imported around 115,000 tonnes of sugar last year, when national consumption was 280,000 tonnes.     an importers association official said that "even if the department no longer imports sugar, we would not necessarily buy more."     this is because the association would still have to compete with the cooperatives wholesale establishment (cwe), he said.     the cwe is a semi-government body and the official said arrangements are being made for state cooperatives and holders of food subsidy stamps to draw their sugar from it, starting april 1.     ministry officials said the cwe can either import sugar or buy it from a local bonded warehousing scheme run by e.d.f. for the past two years.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>revisions to the by-laws of the stock exchange of singapore to be introduced on april 1 will have little impact on the market, brokers and analysts said.     one analyst did say, however, that the removal of fixed commissions on transactions in government securities and asian currency bonds would increase trading volume, because most deals before were transacted directly between clients.     one change will allow stockbroking firms to advertise, but brokers said this would not have much effect because most corporate clients already know the market well.     many remisiers (brokers' agents) and dealers criticised the exchange for not taking the opportunity to abolish or cut transfer fees on remisiers moving to other firms.     one remisier said the transfer fees inhibit an efficient broking system because they restrict brokers' movements.     but most remisiers welcomed the amendment to replace cash deposits with bank guarantees for business transactions. where an extra deposit is needed, it can in future be either in cash or in securities approved by the exchange.     other remisiers felt the new rule that they must report all transactions involving 50,000 dlrs or more to the exchange was unnecessary.     another revision says broking firms are not allowed to improve a buying and selling quote by more than one bid during the last five minutes of trading.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>dutch grain levy test case to start in april</TITLE>
<BODY>a large dutch animal feed compounder will begin formal legal proceedings early next month as a test case on the way the ec grain co-responsibility levy is applied, a spokesman for dutch grain and feed trade association, het comite, told reuters.     het comite has been co-ordinating national actions against alleged distortions caused by currency factors in the levy and, since december, has lodged more than 80 individual cases with the business appeal court in the hague.     the basic complaint is that the levy does not take account of currency cross-rates of exchange and therefore compounders in countries with strong currencies may have to pay more in their own currency than is paid to them by producers in another country.     het comite has obtained a temporary agreement that companies can pay the amount they receive toward the levy rather than paying a full guilder amount to the dutch grain commodity board.     the spokesman said het comite will provide financial and legal backing to the test case in the business administration court in the hague. oral proceedings are to begin on april 10.     the spokesman said het comite finally selected the company for the test case from among the 80 lodged "because the bill (the firm) received from the commodity board for payment of the levy contained significant currency distortions and involved grain from a wide variety of origins." the name of the company is not being made public.     the administration court is not expected to make a final ruling on the case in the near future. the het comite spokesman said it was very likely it would refer questions to the appeal court in luxembourg, and "as a result it could easily be another nine to 12 months before the matter is finally resolved."     meanwhile, the actions by dutch animal feed compounders are putting pressure on the commodity board to urge the dutch government to follow through on earlier statements and seek a complete review in brussels of the way in which the levy is collected, the spokesman said.     het comite, as a member of fefac, the association of european animal feed manufacturers, is also a party to actions protesting the whole levy in the luxembourg appeal court.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>chad's military high command said today troops killed 1,269 libyan soldiers in routing a 5,000-strong force to capture tripoli's major air base in northern chad on sunday.     in its first published casualty list from the fierce battle for ouadi doum air base, the high command said 438 libyans were taken prisoner, while 29 chadian soldiers were killed and 58 wounded.     it said the prisoners included the regional commander, colonel khalifa abul-gassim hastar, while his deputy, colonel gassim ali abu-nawar, was among the dead.     the chadian army also captured substantial amounts of weaponry, including 11 czechoslovak-made l-39 bombers, three soviet mi-24 fighter helicopters and a large number of tanks, as well as hundreds of other vehicles armed with guns or anti-aircraft missiles.     following sunday's battle, french officers said the fall of ouadi doum deprived libya of its only hard runway air base in chad. its main strongpoint, faya largeau some 230 km (150 miles) north of the so-called "red line" along the 16th parallel, was left increasingly exposed.     the 16th parallel divides the central african country into government-held zones in the south and mainly libyan-controlled areas in the north.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>hoechst raises profits on lower sales</TITLE>
<BODY>hoechst ag hfag.f, said in a statement it increased its pretax profits in 1986 despite a fall in turnover due to lower foreign sales.     the lower sales were due to the fall in the dollar and other currencies against the mark. other factors were pressure on selling prices because of a sharp fall in the prices of crude oil and petrochemical raw materials and the sale of polystyrene business in the u.s. and netherlands.     world group pretax profit rose to 3.21 billion marks in 1986 from 3.16 billion in 1985, with sales falling to 38.01 billion from 42.72 billion.     within group turnover, foreign sales fell to 27.18 billion marks in 1986 from 31.92 billion in 1985, a drop of 14.9 pct.     the statement made no mention of net profit figures. hoechst will announce its dividend proposal on april 23.     in the first quarter of this year sales were hit by the cold weather at the start of the year. if the dollar continues at present low levels, 1987 sales will again be below the previous year, although in volume terms they are unchanged from 1986, hoechst said.     sales of paints and dyes, fibres, sheeting and information technology all rose in 1986 but plant construction sales fell.     hoechst attributed its good results to the performance of the parent company, other units in west germany, and to american hoechst corp>.     improved earnings in the u.s. largely reflected the restructuring of styrene and polystyrene activities.     roussel uclaf rucf.pa> and most domestic non-consolidated partners did not perform as well as in 1985.     hoechst attributed the 12 pct rise in parent company pretax profits to 1.82 billion marks above all to a rise in earnings from interest and holdings in other companies, and a fall in extraordinary costs.     the fall in raw material prices was not enough to compensate for the decline in turnover due to lower prices and currencies, hoechst said.     the bulk of the 2.53 billion marks investment in new projects, up from 294 mln marks in 1985, went on the capital increase of hoechst capital corp in connection with the acquisition of celanese corp>.     celanese was merged with american hoechst in february to form hoechst celanese corp>.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>u.s. securities group backs insider restraints</TITLE>
<BODY>the securities industry association backed a variety of restraints on insider trading and hostile corporate takeovers and asked congress to define insider trading in law.     the industry trade association called on u.s. securities firms to take steps to protect sensitive corporate secrets to guard against illegal trading by employees.     the association also backed broad federal restrictions on a variety of tactics used in hostile corporate takeovers.     but it said investment banking firms should be allowed to continue to engage in both arbitrage and merger and acquisition activities so long as those functions were kept separate.     the sia, in a report adopted yesterday by its board of directors, backed a higher enforcement budget for the federal securities and exchange commission and called on u.s. stock exchanges to beef up their supervision of member brokerages.     the report said securities firms "should be more rigorous in restricting sensitive information on a need-to-know basis."     it said firms should train their employees to understand the need for confidentiality of market-sensitive information.     it said legislation to define insider trading should avoid expanding current law in a way that would impede the market.     it said an insider trading definition should exempt a securities firm from liability for law violations by its employees unless the firm had participated in or was aware of the wrongdoing.     in the mergers and acquisitions area, the association advocated a ban on greenmail payments or poison pill takeover protection plans without prior shareholder approval.     it said a group or individual buying up a company's stock should be required to file a public disclosure statement before acquiring more than five pct of the company's shares. under current law, disclosure may be made as late as ten days after exceeding the five pct limit.     the association said all purchases exceeding 20 pct of a company's voting stock shouls be made only through a tender offer open to all shareholders. under current law there is no limit on open market purchases.     the group said the federal government should preempt state regulation of defensive takeover tactics.     the group said all tender offers should remain open for at least 30 calendar days.     the current requirement is expressed in business days.     it said so-called "lockup" devices, in which securities are issued to a friendly investor to seal a takeover deal or fend off an unfriendly predator should be limited to 18.5 pct of the target company's total common stock.     association president edward o'brien said the group acted out of concern over the ad hoc restructuring of corporate america on wall street and investor fears about insider trading and fairness in the marketplace.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>german wage round said to limit monetary options</TITLE>
<BODY>the bundesbank's options for west germany monetary policy are limited for the foreseeable future by the delicate stage of wage negotiations between unions and employers, economists and money market dealers said.     call money fell in quite active trading today, dropping to 3.40/50 pct from 3.55/65 pct yesterday, and below the 3.50 pct treasury bill rate as a difficult month-end approached.     but dealers and economists said the bundesbank was unlikely to encourage lower rates in the foreseeable future largely for fear of upsetting the current wage round.     one money market dealer for a major foreign bank said, "i don't think the bundesbank wants rates to go up whatever happens. but it also does not want them to fall. above all it wants to wait to see how the unions wage round goes."     in west germany, unions and employers prepare the ground for triennial wage negotiations based on detailed assessments of growth and inflation, economists said.     ute geipel, economist with citibank ag, said if the bundesbank became more accommodating in monetary policy, raising fears in some quarters of a return in inflation in the medium term, unions would be obliged to curtail wage demands.     as a result the bundesbank was concerned to make no move that would interfere in the negotiating process, geipel said.     in the current round, the country's most powerful union, the ig metall representing metalworkers and engineers, is demanding a shortening of the working week to 35 hours from the present 38-1/2 and an accompanying five pct increase in wages.     the engineering employers' association, gesamtmetall, is offering to bring in a 38-hour-week from july 1, 1988, and give a two stage wage increase -- a 2.7 pct rise from april 1 this year and another 1.5 pct from july 1, 1988.     the agreement forged by ig metall -- europe's largest union, with 2.5 mln members -- and the employers would set the benchmark for settlements in other industries such as the public sector, banks and federal post office. negotiations began in december and unions are hopeful they may conclude by early april, ahead of the traditional holiday period in june.     though many economists said the unions' current warning strikes and rhetoric were part of the negotiating strategy and would not lead to a repeat of 1984's damaging seven-week strikes, others said unions would not compromise greatly on their positions and there could still be conflict.     this could extend the length of time in which the bundesbank would keep its activity low-key, economists said.     the money market head said the unions' humiliation by the protracted financial problems of the neue heimat cooperative housing venture would contribute to union obstinacy.     "the unions haven't forgotten that and they will put this squarely onto the account in the negotiations," he said.     in addition, the newly-elected chairman of the ig metall union, franz steinkuehler, was more radical and determined than his predecessor hans meyer and may be set for a longer battle to achieve the best possible settlement for his membership.     more than 16,000 engineering workers at 45 firms, mainly in south germany, held warning strikes lasting up to two hours yesterday. firms hit included zahnradfabrik passau gmbh and aerospace group messerschmitt-boelkow-blohm gmbh.     today, 28,000 employees from 110 companies came out in warning strikes, a statement from ig metall said.     money market dealers said that overnight call money rates would rise in the near future in any case and did not depend on a politically-inhibited bundesbank.     about eight billion marks were coming into the market tomorrow from salary payments by the federal government.     as a result, some banks fell back on the bundesbank's offer to mop up liquidity via the sale of three-day treasury bills, anticipating still lower rates before the month-end.     but a pension payment date by banks on behalf of customers was due on monday, other dealers noted. if banks were short of liquidity until the bills matured on tuesday, rates could soar, perhaps to the 5.50 pct lombard ceiling.     banks were well stocked up with funds, having an average 52.1 billion marks in bundesbank minimum reserves in the first 24 days of march, well above the 50.7 billion requirement.  reuter </BODY>

"our position with respect to the dollar goes back to the paris agreement that the currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with underlying economic conditions," baker told a senate committee.     baker continued, "we said further that we and others are willing to cooperate closely to foster stability in exchange rates around those levels."     he referred to a february agreement by six leading industrial nations to cooperate on monetary matters.     baker refused to answer a question whether japan and germany had done enough to stimulate their domestic economies for the united states to support the dollar.     "i will not comment because the foreign exchange market reads more or less than is intended in my statements," baker said.     baker said that the other signatories recognized that they must carry their share of the load of correcting external imbalances that have hindered the world's economy.     he cited news reports that germany would increase a proposed tax cut for 1988 by about five billion marks to stimulate domestic growth.     japan also agreed to consider stimulative measures after the japanese budget was made final.     baker said those nations were stimulating their economies in a manner consistent with gains against inflation.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>china must cut demand, continue reforms: zhao</TITLE>
<BODY>china must cut excess demand and capital investment in the face of budget and foreign exchange deficits but will press ahead with wide-ranging economic reforms in 1987, premier zhao ziyang told parliament.     zhao told the annual meeting of the national people's congress that while china cooled its overheated economy, cut its trade deficit and raised national living standards in 1986, serious imbalances remain.     zhao said total social demand exceeds total supply, and demand for consumer goods, especially from state firms, is too high. "(they) squander public funds to a serious extent ... (and issue) excessive wage and bonus increases," he said.     failure to cut this excess will "result in reduced accumulation of funds...and serve to corrupt social morality," zhao said. he said there was a contradiction between low per capita incomes and excessively high consumer demand.     china needs to accumulate enormous funds for construction in its initial stage of socialist modernisation and consumption must match the available resources, he said.     zhao said there was a deficit in state finances in 1986 because of the sharp fall in world oil prices, the rising cost of foreign exchange earnings through exports, reduced income from customs duties and unreasonably heavy spending.     investment in energy, transport, telecommunications and raw and semi-finished materials industries is inadequate and investment in non-productive projects is too large, he said.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>leading u.s. farm state senators are seeking to insert into the senate's omnibus trade bill a provision that would broaden eligibility requirements under the u.s. agriculture department's export enhancement program, eep, to include traditional buyers of u.s. farm products, including the soviet union, senate staff said.     under existing criteria, usda can offer eep subsidies to recoup export markets lost to competing nations' unfair trading practices.     senate agriculture committee chairman patrick leahy (d-vt.) is leading a group of farm state senators in an effort to broaden the criteria in such a way as to enable moscow to be eligible for the subsidies, sources said.     the senators -- including senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen (d-tex.), max baucus (d-mont.), david pryor (d-ark.), john melcher (d-mont.) and thad cochran (r-miss.) -- also may fold into the trade bill a measure to shield pork producers and processors from canadian imports.     the measure, sponsored by sen. charles grassley (r-iowa), would clarify the definition of "industry" in determining whether or not imports were causing injury to u.s. producers.     grassley's bill stems from a 1985 decision by the international trade commission that imports from canada of live swine -- but not fresh, chilled and frozen pork -- were harming u.s. producers.     the bill's proponents have argued canada has simply replaced shipments of live hogs with fresh pork.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>u.s. banks seen stepping up securities role</TITLE>
<BODY>the glass-steagall act separating banking and securities activities in the u.s. is all but dead following decisions by federal and state authorities, the chairman of bankers trust co asserted.     "there are plainly nails in the coffin of glass-steagall," alfred brittain said in remarks prepared for delivery to a meeting of bank and financial analysts.     he noted the federal reserve board is due to decide bankers trust's application for a subsidiary that can underwrite certain securities.     brittain said new york state bank regulators have welcomed applications for affiliates of new york-chartered banks which could underwrite corporate securities. and he said a u.s. court of appeals upheld bankers trust's commercial paper business.     he said eventually the financial services industry will see fewer but bigger companies drawn from the ranks of the present commercial banks, investment banks and conglomerates.     on another topic, britain called for a redefinition of the role of the federal deposit insurance corporation.     "i think we should return to the original purpose of fdic insurance -- to protect small despositors and not depository institutions themselves," brittain said.     he suggested banks be permitted to offer both insured deposits and uninsured deposits. high quality assets would be segregated to back up insured deposits.     he said big banks could then fail without draining the insurance funds. "stockholders could be wiped out, management rmemoved and uninsured creditors could take their fair share of any losses," he said. but insured deposits under 100,000 dlrs would be protected.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>u.k. trade figures buoy hopes of interest rate cut</TITLE>
<BODY>the release of u.k. february trade data showing that the current account surplus was a provisional 376 mln stg, up from a 73 mln surplus in january, has boosted hopes of an early cut in interest rates, analysts said.     market forecasts had been for a worse outcome, with expectations of a deficit in visible trade averaging about 750 mln stg, against the official figure of 224 mln stg, sharply narrower than january's 527 mln deficit.     "the figures are unreservedly good," chase manhattan securities economist andrew wroblewski said.     sterling rebounded on the trade figures, reversing a weaker morning trend, to stand at 72.1 pct of its trade weighted index against a basket of currencies at midday, unchanged from yesterday's close but 0.3 points above the 1100 gmt level.     the market had feared that a deteriorating non-oil trade pattern would undermine international support for sterling, which has been the motor behind the recent fall in u.k. interest rates. money market sources said the market had begun to doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates to 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards.     but sentiment now looks to have turned about again.     there now looks to be no danger that the chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson's forecast of a 1987 current account deficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded, said wroblewski.     seasonally adjusted figures showed that imports rose in february to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in january.     exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion.     however, chris tinker, u.k. analyst at brokers phillips and drew said that the faster rise in exports than imports would prove partly aberrational in coming months. he forecast the chancellor's budget tax cuts would increase consumer expediture on imported goods.     however, ian harwood, economist at warburg securities, said his firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit forecast in the light of the latest data, cutting one billion stg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg.     he said news of strong growth in exports of non-oil goods confirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the confederation of british industry.     the growth in imports appears to be flattening, even if january's bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas goods and import-intensive stock building among manufactureres, harwood said.     u.k. government bonds, or gilts, surged by more than 1/2 point on the better-than-expected news, as earlier worries about the figures evaporated.     sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs, before settling to a steady 1.6050 dlrs about 1300 gmt, nearly a cent higher than the european low of 1.5960.     however, analysts noted that the turnabout in market sentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news.     morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was largely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the conservative government's support was slipping.     the marplan poll, published in "today," showed conservative support had fallen to 36 pct, from 38 pct last month, while the alliance of liberals and social democrats had rallied to 31 pct, from 21 pct, to run neck and neck with the labour party, whose own support fell from 38 pct.     the poll was taken after the budget, which was greeted enthusiastically by financial markets but seems to have left the voters indifferent, political observers said.     another regular poll is due tomorrow, and eonomists warn that today's improved sentiment could be dented if support for prime minister margaret thatcher slips again.     this upsetting of the markets' political perceptions, which are all but discounting a conservative victory in the upcoming general election, made them more sensitive to the trade data, harwood said. "the news did come as a very, very substantial relief," he said.     however, on the interest rate front, economists caution that lawson might be wary of leaving sterling vulnerable by encouraging another base rate fall. they noted lawson had already got an inflation-reducing cut in mortgage rates in response to lower base rates, so domestic political reasons for lower rates have been curtailed.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>u.s. sugar quota may be eased, congressman says</TITLE>
<BODY>the united states may soon ease its 1987 sugar import quota of one mln short tons by bringing forward to the third quarter some shipments scheduled for the fourth quarter of 1987, jerry huckaby, a leading congressman representing sugar growers told reuters in an interview.     huckaby, a louisiana democrat and chairman of the house subcommittee which deals with the sugar program, indicated the easing of the quota might be a way to calm the concern about the impact of the severe cut in u.s. sugar imports this year.     "with imports coming down from 1.8 mln (last year) to one mln, there is legitimate concern about the impacts on caribbean countries and the philippines," huckaby said.     by bringing forward to the third quarter some imports, the quota would effectively be eased by about 250,000 tons.     huckaby said by simply bringing forward to the third quarter of the year sugar imports scheduled for the september to december period "we could get away without having to increase the quota."     he noted that some in the sugar industry believe an increase in the quota is justified.     earlier this month, representatives of u.s. cane sugar refiners met with u.s. agriculture department officials to request a quota increase of at least 200,000 tons. the refiners said the increase is needed because the quota is so restrictive there could be some spot shortages of sugar in the u.s later this year, a refiner spokesman said.     however, the official slaid the usda replied only that it would consider the request.     following the refiners' request, representatives of the florida sugarcane producers met with usda to express opposition to any quota expansion, industry sources said.     the statement by huckaby, who as a representative from a sugar growing district in louisiana is a leading architect of the current sugar program, indicates at least some grower officials are concerned enough to support an easing of the import quota, industry officials said.     any final decision on easing the quota must be made by the reagan administration's interagency sugar policy group.     asked about possible quota changes, a usda official said "as far as i know, changing the quota volume or the quota year is not under active consideration."  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>malaysia's foreign borrowing held at 1986 level</TITLE>
<BODY>malaysia's net external borrowings for 1987 are expected to be maintained at around last year's levels of about 1.45 billion ringgit, zain azraai, secretary general to the finance ministry, told an investment seminar here.     malaysia's debt service ratio will also be maintained at "a level no higher than 20 pct," he said. "this is well within the capacity of the nation to service."     azraai said the 1986 foreign borrowing level and projected estimates of 1987 compared favourably with the peak of around 5.5 billion ringgit in 1982.     malaysia's external debts total 48 to 49 billion ringgit and its debt service ratio exceeds 20 pct, the development bank of singapore ltd, one of singapore's four major local banks, said in a report released this week.     azraai said: "while the growth in debt has been rapid in recent years, it is still within the limits of prudence and conscious efforts have been made and will continue to be made to decelerate and restrain external borrowings."     he said the malaysian government is urgently addressing the twin deficits of the federal budget and the balance of payments which followed two recessions in the 1980s.     azraai said malaysia's public sector deficit had risen due to the contraction in the government's resources as well as the rapid growth in public expenditures.     with declining incomes and export earnings, the bases for resource generation became limited, and the government will not raise taxes because current tax margins are high compared to malaysia's neighbours, he said.     "as such the remaining avenue for rationalising and consolidating the budget is through expenditure reductions," he said.     azraai said the malaysian government's development expenditures were cut by about 25 pct in 1987, while those of state enterprises were reduced by 41 pct.     he said: "a commitment has been undertaken to reduce the budget deficit over time and to balance the federal government's budget current account deficit by 1989."     malaysian finance minister daim zainuddin presented a budget for 1987 which foresees a deficit of 9.4 billion ringgit, down from 11.6 billion in 1986, with federal spending targetted at 27.4 billion, down from 30.8 billion, and revenue at 18 billion against 19.2 billion.     azraai said the government will cut the size of the public sector and privatize those operations which may be better run by the private sector. new measures have been introduced to boost the private sector and attract foreign investment.     a higher proportion of foreign ownership, even up to 100 pct, is now possible for new investments in the manufacturing sector made between october 1986 and december 1990, he said.     "the long term prospects of the malaysian economy are bright ... indications are already available to show that the economy is recovering and that growth will be positive and stronger than originally expected," azraai said.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>bank of japan governor satoshi sumita said it is in japan's national interest to make greater efforts to reduce its trade surplus.     he told business executives the most important issues for the world economy are the correction of international trade imbalances and a solution to the world debt problem.     to this end, japan and the u.s. must make medium- and long-term efforts to alter economic structures which have expanded the trade gap between the two nations. world economic growth and therefore an expansion of debtor countries' export markets are needed to solve the debt issue, he added.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>argentina says could follow brazilian debt move</TITLE>
<BODY>central bank president jose luis machinea said argentina could adopt the same posture as brazil and suspend payments on its foreign debt if it failed to meet creditor bank demands.     "if argentina had the same difficulties in being unable to refinance (its debt) under the desired (creditor) conditions, that (brasil's) is a path to take," machinea said.     brasil last month suspended payments on a large part of its 109-billion dlr debt, the highest in the developing world.     machinea said brasil did not suspend payments because it wanted to but because it lacked reserves.     argentina has since last month been negotiating a 2.15 billion dlr loan with the steering committee for its international creditor banks to meet 1987 growth targets.     but machinea said the talks were difficult and argentina wanted to conclude them as soon as possible.     "what the (creditor) banks are demanding is not the same as what argentina is prepared to concede," machinea said.     argentina has a global foreign debt of 50 billion dlrs. its debt with private banks is about 30 billion dlrs.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>the ferruzzi group's holding company agricola finanziara spa will pay 630 mln dlrs for the european corn wet milling business of cpc international inc under the agreement reached in principle between the two companies, a statement by ferruzzi released by its brussels office said.     when cpc announced the agreement yesterday in new york, it said only that the price would be in excess of 600 mln dlrs.     ferruzzi said the deal is subject to agreement on several clauses of the contract and needs government authorisations.     it said the deal would involve 13 starch factories employing about 5,000 people in eight european community countries plus facilities and commercial operations in other ec states.     the factories have a capacity to produce the equivalent of 1.6 mln tonnes of starch in starch and by-products a year, or about one third of ec production, from about 2.7 mln tonnes of cereals.     ferruzzi said the acquisition of these assets would extend its presence in the european agro-industrial industry both geographically and in terms of products.     it said it is already the principal ec producer of sugar and of soya oil and cake, and the major cereal trader.     it noted that ec output of isoglucose is subject to maximum quotas, of which cpc currently holds a 25 pct share, and said it foresaw an increase in other industrial uses of starch in the future, notably in the production of ethanol for fuel.     raul gardini, president of the ferruzzi group, said the present management of the cpc milling business will be asked to remain in their posts.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>lomac inc, a publicly traded company, will pay the u.s. and michigan governments to help clean up a toxic waste site in the first major settlement under the 1986 superfund-two act, michigan officials said.     lomac will pay 17 mln dlrs to help clean the site, they said.     stewart freeman, michigan's chief environmental attorney, told reuters that lomac, a new company, agreed to buy a chemical site near muskegon, mich., formerly operated by bafors nobel inc, a bankrupt subsidiary of a.b. nobel of sweden.     the settlement was also the largest in history in a bankruptcy case involving environmental issues, freeman said.     other companies with superfund disputes are watching the case closely, he said. "there are a number of very large corporations talking to the attorney general," freeman said, referring to michigan atty. gen. frank j. kelley.     freeman would not identify the companies involved, saying he was not sure whether confidentiality agreements had been made.     lomac will pay 25-26 mln dlrs in the settlement. five mln dlrs will be paid to the federal and 12 mln dlrs will go to the michigan government for cleanup at the site, the lakeway chemical plant.     the remaining funds will go to medical surveillance of former workers at the plant.     under the agreement, a trust fund will be set up "to monitor the health of employees who may have been exposed to dangerous chemicals that were manufactured at the plant before 1971," the michigan attorney general's office said in a statement.     freeman said the medical fund was necessary because of possible medical problems among workers at the site.     the muskegon facility was formerly used to manufacture dyes. freeman said bofors nobel spent 50 mln dlrs cleaning up the site, formerly owned by lakeway chemical co, before "the economic decision was made in sweden" to place the operation in bankruptcy.     under the agreement, bofors nobel will sell the site, which still holds an operating chemical plant, to lomac. some 150 employees work at the plant, a spokesman for the michigan attorney general said.     the state attorney general said cleanup at the site will begin "immediately," and will be supervised by federal and state officials.     freeman said the plant site is not presently listed on the federal superfund list, which qualifies the toxic waste site for federal cleanup funds.     he said federal officials will try to get the muskegon facility onto the superfund list. if they are unable to do so, the 5.0 mln dlr federal portion of the settlement will be turned over to michigan officials to be used in the cleanup, freeman said.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>ec sugar tender seen as further concession</TITLE>
<BODY>the rebates granted at yesterday's ec sugar tender represent a further concession to producers' complaints that they are losing money on exports outside the bloc, trade sources said.     they said the maximum rebate of 45.678 european currency units (ecus) per 100 kilos was 0.87 ecus below what producers claim is needed to obtain the equivalent price to that offered for sales into intervention.     the rebate at last week's tender was 1.3 ecus short of the level producers thought necessary and that of the previous week was 2.5 ecus below this level.     but the sources said producers who have offered a total of 854,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention in an apparent attempt to persuade the commission to set higher maximum rebates have given no formal indication to the commission that they intend to withdraw these offers.     the french and german operators involved would be able to withdraw the offers up to five weeks after april 1 when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores.     the five-week period is the normal delay between sugar going into intervention and payment being made for it.     ec officials have said that if the commission has to buy the sugar, it is determined immediately to resell it, a move which could drive down market prices further.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>iwc lifts world grain output estimate to record</TITLE>
<BODY>the international wheat council (iwc) lifted its estimate for 1986/87 world wheat and coarse grain production by one mln tonnes to a record 1,377 mln, compared with 1,351 mln tonnes the previous season.     in its monthly market report, the iwc said it is leaving unchanged its forecast of world wheat production for the coming 1987/88 season at between 520 and 530 mln tonnes against a record 534 mln in 1986/87. the one mln tonne upward revision in 1986/87 wheat production reflects several minor adjustments. the iwc raised the 1986/87 coarse grain trade figure two mln to 87 mln tonnes. it left wheat trade unchanged at 86 mln.     the iwc 1986/87 estimate for world trade in wheat and coarse grain is thus estimated two mln tonnes higher at 173 mln against 169 mln the previous season with the forecast three mln rise in soviet imports offset by small reductions elsewhere.     the iwc said the area harvested for wheat in 1987/88 is likely to be down from last year as low world prices and restrictive national policies measures begin to take effect.     at least four of the five major exporters expect to see a drop in wheat sowings without offset in other countries. there is still potential for even higher average wheat yields but the iwc said there are increasing signs world output may level off.     although it is still early to assess the coarse grain outlook, the iwc said barley acreage is likely to fall in the european community but increase in canada. u.s. maize area is expected lower but oat sowings could rise.     after damage to its maize crop last year, the soviet union plans to expand this area by as much as 50 pct to over six mln hectares in a year when many frost damaged wheat fields are likely to be resown to this and other spring crops. improved weather and a further increase in the use of intensive cultivation methods could therefore see a marked rise in soviet maize output in 1987, the iwc said.     any reduction in world coarse grain output would be bolstered by the large carryover stocks from 1986/87, the iwc said.     it left its estimates of wheat and coarse grain stocks at endof different marketing years unchanged at 178 and 210 mln tonnes, respectively, against 160 and 167 mln a year earlier.     after record world durum wheat production of 218.8 mln tonnes last season, the iwc said there are already signs of another large crop this coming season with higher output expected in the ec, canada, the u.s. and north africa.  reuter </BODY>

"that would not be wise," he said.     he said that the extension of the short-term lines would not be carried out through "an official instrument" as there was not time to complete the legal requirements.     gros said brazil was likely to meet again with the 14-bank advisory committee once brazil had information to present on an economic plan.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>guinness plc, has joined investors suing former wall street speculator ivan boesky, alleging it was deceived into putting money into his one billion dlr investment partnership in 1986.     guinness, the largest limited partner in ivan f. boeksy and co. l.p., is the latest to file suit in federal court in manhattan against boesky, court papers show.     about 40 other investors have also filed suit over similar allegations, including that boesky did not reveal his illegal insider trading activities.     guinness is charging it was induced to join in the boesky partnership through a prospectus that contained "material untrue statements and omissions."     the suit also alleged that the boesky corporation, which became a part in the formation of the investment partnership, ivan f. boesky and co., l.p., "had achieved its extraordinary rates of return as a result of trading on inside information and other violations of the securities laws."     in addition, the suit charged that boesky and other defendants unlawfully "schemed with and provided substantial assistance to one another to evade the registration provisions" of securities law.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>ec ministers fail to end deadlock on research plan</TITLE>
<BODY>the european community (ec) has failed to agree on a high-technology research program because of opposition from britain and west germany, diplomats said.     but belgian research minister guy verhofstadt told reporters the two had been given just over a week to end their opposition or risk plunging ec research into a crisis.     the so-called "framework program" proposed by the ec's executive commission was designed to boost research in areas such as computers, biotechnology and telecommunications and combat u.s. and japanese domination in these fields.     the five-year program was due to start at the beginning of this year, but was delayed by calls from britain, france and west germany for cuts in the proposed budget of 7.7 billion european currency units (ecus), diplomats said.     the ec commission had already cut the budget from 10.5 billion ecus, but under ec law the program needs the approval of all member states before it can be launched.     france has withdrawn its objections and backed a new compromise budget proposed by verhofstadt to trim spending.     but britain is continuing its demands for further, sharp cuts in the budget.     west germany, which yesterday appeared to be ready to accept the compromise, was also holding back.     verhofstadt, who chaired the lengthy meeting, said he had given the two states until april 3 to withdraw their opposition.     but if one or both failed to do so, the ec would be left without a research program, leaving no money for schemes such as the ec's esprit information technology drive.     "if that happened ... there would be a grave crisis in europe's scientific and research policy," verhofstadt said, adding it could mean research teams being disbanded.     diplomats said west germany was close to agreeing to the compromise, which would limit new spending to 5.4 billion ecus by allowing for cash already set aside for future projects.     the plan would also set aside at least 16 pct of the 5.4 billion ecus for spending after the end of the five-year program, they said. but britain still maintained the allocations were much too high.     britain's research minister geoffrey pattie faced a tough fight to convince his government colleagues they should accept an increase in spending beyond the 4.2 billion ecu level so far demanded by britain, one diplomat added.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>fed adopts redeposit service for bounced checks</TITLE>
<BODY>the federal reserve board unanimously approved a proposal to allow federal reserve banks to offer a redeposit service for bounced checks.     the service would allow a commercial bank that sends checks to a reserve bank for collection to instruct the reserve bank to redeposit a bounced check rather than return it.     the reserve banks would be required to charge a fee for the redeposit service that would cover its costs.     the plan would leave it to each reserve bank to set a dollar cutoff for eligible returns.     the fed acted after industry studies showed that nearly two-thirds of bounced checks cleared the second time around.     the fed said studies show that fewer than one pct of the more than 40 billion checks written each year in the united states are returned unpaid.     of those returned, about half are written for less than 100 dlrs.     the fed said many commercial banks already routinely redeposit low-dlr-value checks returned to them for insufficient funds.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>treasury secretary james baker said he stood by the paris agreement among leading industrial nations to foster exchange rate stability around current levels.     "i would refer you to the paris agreement which was a recognition the currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals," baker told the cable news network in an interview.     "we were quite satisfied with the agreement in paris otherwise we would not have been a party too it," he said.     baker also noted the nations agreed in the accord to "co-operate to foster greater exchange rate stability around those levels."     he refused to comment directly on the current yen/dollar rate but said flatly that foreign exchange markets recently tended "to draw unwarranted inferences from what i say."     baker was quoted on british television over the weekend as saying he has no target for the u.s. currency, a statement that triggered this week's renewed decline of the dollar.     "i think the paris agreement represents evidence that international economic policy co-ordination is alive and well," baker said.     the treasury secretary stressed however it was very important for the main surplus countries to grow as fast as they could consistent with low inflation to resolve trade imbalances.     he added that federal reserve board chairman paul volcker has also "been very outspoken" in suggesting main trading partners grow as fast as they can.      reuter </BODY>

"while financial results are far from the previous year's record levels, it is clear that norcen has withstood declining prices and remains financially and operationally strong," norcen said. it did not give a specific 1987 profit forecast.     the company said it is well positioned to capitalize on profitable opportunities in its core business areas, and will continue to invest to increase revenue and asset values.  reuter </BODY>

"this is the best available protection against aids next to abstinence," he said.     but david pennington, the head of australia's government sponsored aids taskforce, said the use of the cream provided a slight safeguard but was no great breakthrough.     pennington said that in the event of a condom rupturing semen was likely to travel beyond the cream's range.     humphrey said the studies, commissioned by ansell from nelson gantz of the university of massachusetts and fred judson of the university of colorado, showed nonoxynol-nine destroyed the aids virus present in 100 pct of rupture tests.     but he said it was not known whether nonoxynol-nine was as effective in sexual situations.     he stressed it was neither a cure nor a vaccine for aids.     humphrey said nonoxynol-nine had been used for about 20 years as a spermicidal cream without side-effects.     analysts have attributed much of the rise in pacific dunlop's share price from 3.87 dlrs at the beginning of the year to a high of 5.36 dlrs to expected growth in its condom business. it closed today eight cents down at 4.67 dlrs.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>cattlemen assessing death loss from storm</TITLE>
<BODY>blizzard conditions in parts of the west and southwest u.s. severely stressed beef cattle and kansas cattlemen are reporting death losses from the storm, according to livestock associations in the area.     talk among futures traders that cattle had died from the cold and blowing snow accounted for some of the strength in live cattle futures at the chicago mercantile exchange today.     "death (of cattle) can be directly attributed to the storm, but it's hard to get a handle on a number," todd domer, director of communications for the kansas livestock association said.     domer noted that limited reports have been filtering in of death losses at feedyards and from grazing and cow/calf operations. western kansas was hardest hit while eastern kansas only had rain, he said.     paul johnston of the nebraska livestock feeders association said, "there's no question that baby calves coming in that kind of blizzard are probably not going to make it."     we were having such a nice winter and the cows were out calving before the storm hit, he added.     the worst part of the storm came through the center of the state. precipitation was generally in the form of wet snow and some feedlots are already like "soup", he said, inhibiting cattle movements.     the storm also had an effect on weight gain of larger animals. drifting snow caused problems in moving feed and mud made it hard for cattle to reach the feed once it was available.     domer noted that feedyards sources say a tremendous cutback has occurred in feed consumption by cattle in the yards, which may or may not lead to sickness over the next several days. cattle reduced daily feed consumption to about 12 lbs from 25 during the worst of the blizzard, he said.     mud will be more a problem as the weather breaks and snow melts. mud adds to stress on full-grown animals and endangers smaller ones which can fall and be trampled in pens. the cost of feeding rises as animals generally consume more in cold weather, domer said.     domer said it will be at least 10 days before yards get back to normal.     roy gallant, from accu weather services, said that although the worst of the storm is over, there are still some strong gusty winds which will not diminish until tonight.     the storm started late sunday night in west kansas and is just now winding down. the storm has moved into south dakota, parts of minnesota and eastern north dakota, he said.     snow accumulations from the storm totaled six to 10 inches in most sections and 12 to 18 in a few spots before moving north. this equals 1/2 to 1-1/2 inches of water. drifts of four to six feet and up to 12 feet were reported, he said.     there's a possibility of another storm brushing that region tomorrow night and friday, gallant added.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>cocoa council chairman seeks buffer compromise</TITLE>
<BODY>international cocoa organization, icco, council chairman, denis bra kanon, said he will attempt to reach a compromise on buffer stock rules for the international cocoa agreement.     bra kanon called for bilateral consultations among producers and consumers thursday morning to resolve outstanding differences on how much non-member cocoa the buffer stock can purchase and differentials to be fixed for different origin cocoa, consumer delegates told reporters.     bra kanon is expected to meet with about eight delegations individually in attempt to iron out remaining problems.     producers and consumers indicated support "in principle" for the draft buffer stock rules package formulated over the past week by a small working group, consumer delegates said.     despite remaining differences delegates remained confident a buffer stock accord would be agreed to by friday when the council session ends, but certain technical points need further clarification, the delegates said.     certain consumers are concerned that differentials included in the draft buffer stock package are out of line with market realities, consumer delegates said.     unless these are modified there are fears it would promote purchases of quality cocoas, such as ghana origin, which are normally required by manufacturers, they said.     restrictions on buffer stock purchases of non-member cocoa might lead to a supply overhang in malaysian cocoa, which would depress prices, they added.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>farm credit system to ask for congressional aid</TITLE>
<BODY>a senior representative of the financially-troubled u.s. farm credit system is expected for the first time tomorrow to ask congress to provide assurances that stock held by system borrowers will be guaranteed.     farm credit sources said brent beesley, president of the farm credit corporation which represents the system, will make the request at a senate agriculture subcommittee hearing.     they said beesley would ask congress to take some action to assure borrowers the stock is secure. but beesley is expected to stop short of requesting other forms of government aid.     borrowers from the farm credit system hold some four billion dlrs in system stock which could be devalued if the mounting losses of the system persist, officials said.     beesley's request expected tomorrow is seen as the first official acknowledgment from the system itself that federal aid will be needed to guarantee the value of the stock.     yesterday, jim billington, a member of the farm credit administration board which regulates the system, said congress should plan to spend at least 800 mln dlrs beginning late this year to bail-out the system.     congress is moving swiftly toward legislation to aid the system. sen. james mcclure, r-idaho, has drafted a resolution which would put the senate on record as guaranteeing the value of farm credit system stock. the resolution may be brought to the senate floor soon, congressional sources said.     in addition to requesting a guarantee of borrower stock, beesley is expected tomorrow to endorse the creation of a secondary market, called "aggie-mae" by some proponents, for the resale of farm real estate loans.     sources said the farm credit system will support the idea if the system is included in the operation of the market.     farm credit sources said the system decided to request a guarantee of borrower stock at a meeting this week in denver of the 12 presidents of farm credit system districts.     beesley's testimony to the congressional hearing tomorrow will not include any new financial forecast of system losses, officials said.     chairman of the fca, frank naylor, yesterday said the system may lose as much as 1.4 billion dlrs this year.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>economic spotlight - swiss banking secrecy</TITLE>
<BODY>swiss lawyers have largely headed off an attempt to restrict banking secrecy and curb their powers to act for clients despite the new, revised code of banking conduct agreed by the bankers' association this week, analysts said.     the "laundering" of drug and "insider dealing" money and controversy over accounts of the ousted philippine and haitian presidents have hurt the standing of swiss banks recently and strained international relations, particularly with the united states.     critics said the new code fell well short of demands for reform, doing little to close a key loophole in the requirement that banks know the identity of their customers.     the social democratic party, a member of the ruling four-party coalition, which forced an unsuccesful 1984 referendum to curb banking secrecy, complained the code still fell short of the legal controls they wanted.     "it looks a slight improvement on paper, but the same tricks will still be possible in practice," felix meier, a senior party official, told reuters.     in contrast, swiss lawyers are happy with the new code.     "apart from a few nuances, we are very pleased with the agreement," said max oesch, a senior official of the swiss lawyers federation, which has fought a long campaign to prevent any curbs on lawyers' ability to act for their clients.     "it has shown that the 4,000 swiss lawyers who do a good job should not be punished for the sake of getting at the one or two black sheep."     the role of lawyers has been at the centre of long running discussions on the renewal of the so-called "convention of diligence," a voluntary code of banking conduct introduced in response to a major banking scandal here in 1977.     with secrecy back in the public eye due to the ferdinand marcos case and a swiss bank link to the recently busted "pizza connection" international heroin ring, officials at the banking commission said earlier this year they wanted a tightening of rules on anonymity.     however, the changes in the new code, which comes into operation in october, have been minor.     clients will still be able to keep their identity secret from the banks provided their lawyer pledges that the relationship with his client "is not only of a temporary nature" and involves provision of other legal services.     the lawyers' association said this part of their business is very minimal anyway. in the majority of cases, people had perfectly legal private or commercial reasons for not wanting the bank to know their identity, oesch said.     the banking commission, despite its earlier demand for a virtual abolition of the loophole, also said it was happy with the new code.     however, critics complain that the agreement does not go far enough to restrict the role of lawyers and could still be circumvented by criminals.     "no other group in society is allowed to regulate itself as much as the banks," complained meier of the social democrats. "i hope that the banking commission exercises its proper control function."     however, other parts of the agreement won praise.     in particular, banks will also now be required to demand the identity anyone doing more than 100,000 swiss francs worth of business with them, even if they do not have an account at the bank. until now, the threshold was 500,000 francs.     peter kluser, head of the national bank's legal department, which had argued for a lower limit, said the move could help combat the use of banks to "launder" or hide the criminal origin of money.     the new code also clarifies the legal status of a tribunal able to impose heavy fines on banks which do not respect the code.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>bolivian debt buyback plan said gaining ground</TITLE>
<BODY>bolivia's proposal to repurchase at a deep discount the 900 mln dlrs it owes to foreign commercial banks is likely to be accepted, bolivian central bank governor javier nogales iturri said.     speaking to reporters at the annual meeting of the inter- american development bank, nogales said bolivia's bank advisory committee, led by bank of america, is seeking permission from creditor banks worldwide to go ahead with the scheme.     more than 50 pct of the banks must approve, and nogales said he is confident this threshold will be reached.     "it's working out very well, and i think we'll get a clear majority," nogales said.     a senior banker working on the deal also said that banks are responding positively and said all the legal waivers necessary could be obtained within two months.     bolivia halted all payments on its commercial bank debt in march 1984. hyperinfltion has been curbed and public spending trimmed, but the country's debt still trades as low as 10 cts on the dollar on the secondary market, and many banks have written off most, if not all, of their loans to the country.     few bankers see little chance for a subtantive recovery in bolivia's economic fortunes and so are willing to collect what they can on the loans.     nogales said bolivia would offer to buy back the debt at a market price. he said some banks might want to hold out for a higher price, but others would see the repurchase offer as an opportunity to cut their losses.     bolivia intends to pay for the repurchase with aid that foreign goernments, especially the united states and west germany, are providing to help finance the eradication of coca crops. cocaine, although illegal, is bolivia's largest export.     the campaign to persuade farmers to grow legal crops instead of coca would be financed instead using local currency, nogales said.     because the fiscal deficit has been reduced to some four pct of gross domestic product, money supply could be increased to pay for the drug-eradication drive without too much of n impact on inflation, he added.     nogales said he does not expect bolivia's debt repurchase to become a model for other debtors in dire straits. "we're not seeking a universal solution," he said."  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>the house energy and commerce committee approved major trade legislation that will give president reagan authority to retaliate if negotiations to open foreign markets to u.s. telecommunications products fail.     the provision was part of a major trade bill the committee approved on a vote of 26 to 15. it will be wrapped into a trade bill being written in several house committees and due to be considered in the full house in late april.     the bill also requires foreign investors to file detailed reports to the commerce department on their u.s. holdings in real estate, securities or u.s. companies.     in response to congressional concern over the fujitsu proposal to take control of fairchild semiconductor corp., the bill would give reagan the power to bar foreign acquisitions of u.s. firms if the sale threatened u.s. national security.     the legislation would bar for one year imports of advanced audio digital tape machines unless the recording capability is disabled. the action was taken after the u.s. recording industry said the new machines would lead to rampant recording piracy and legislation was needed to protect their rights.     the bill authorizes government spending of 100 mln dlrs a year for five years to help pay for research by a consortia of semiconductor manufacturers.      reuter </BODY>

"i'm still trying to get a budget that meets the gramm-rudman target," reagan said.

<TITLE>dollar expected to fall despite intervention</TITLE>
<BODY>central bank intervention in the foreign exchange markets succeeded in staunching the dollar's losses today, but senior dealers here believe the u.s. currency is headed for a further retreat.     although the intervention was widespread, dealers perceive that the six major industrial nations have differing levels of commitment to their recent accord to stabilize currencies.     moreover, hard economic realities hold greater sway over the currency market than central bank intervention and these argue for a further dollar decline, dealers said.     "the market can be bigger than the central banks. and economic fundamentals will always come to the fore," said a dealer at one major u.s. bank.     as the dollar dropped to post-world war ii lows against the yen today foreign exchange traders said the bank of japan, federal reserve board and bank of england intervened in the markets on behalf of the u.s. currency.     reports of the authorities' actions helped the dollar recover to about 149.45 yen in new york this afternoon from the post-war low of 148.20 yen in the far east. but it still failed to regain monday's u.s. closing level of 150.00/05 yen.     tokyo dealers said the bank of japan bought one to 1.5 billion dlrs in tokyo today and may also have purchased dollars yesterday in the u.s. via the federal reserve.     meanwhile, there were strong rumors in new york that the fed also bought a modest amount of dollars around 148.50 yen today. talk also circulated that the bank of england purchased a small amount of dollars for yen.     the fed's last confirmed intervention was on january 28 when it bought 50 mln dlrs in coordination with the bank of japan. but on march 11 the fed also was rumored to have signalled displeasure with a dollar surge above 1.87 marks.     the authorities' actions appeared to back up the february 22 paris pact between the u.s., japan, west germany, britain, france and canada under which the nations agreed to cooperate to foster exchange rate stability around prevailing levels.     but foreign exchange dealers were not overly impressed by the authorities' intervention which they said can only soften extreme moves in the market.     for one thing, some dealers believed that the fed's purchases were done on behalf of the bank of japan rather than for the u.s. central bank's own account, suggesting a rather   watered-down american commitment to the currency accord.     the bank of england's action also was thought to be completed on behalf of the japanese central bank, reinforcing the market's view that japan is the most resolute of the six nations in its support of the currency pact.     "no-one doubts the bank of japan is serious. but the other two central banks seem to be making more token gestures than anything else," said chris bourdain of bankamerica corp.     "i'm not convinced the intervention was concerted," said earl johnson of harris trust and savings bank in chicago.  "it's a yen problem more than anything else."     some dealers said a rising wave of trade protectionist sentiment in the u.s. limits the extent to which the american authorities can endorse a stronger dollar against the yen.     "the dollar's break below the key 150 yen level ties the treasury's hands behind its back. the u.s. cannot intervene on its own account because of the strength of protectionism here," said albert soria of swiss bank corp.     such comments reflect the view that the currency markets are becoming increasingly politicized. despite official denials, some traders still feel the u.s. would countenance a lower dollar to help trim the nation's trade deficit.     the majority of the 170 billion dlr merchandise trade deficit in 1986 was with japan.     indeed u.s. treasury secretary james baker's comment on sunday that the february currency pact had not established dollar targets was read by the market as a signal to sell the u.s. currency and kicked off the latest retreat.     "the dollar still has more room on the downside against the yen based on the frictions in trade and financial services. the currency market is becoming very political," said natsuo okada of sumitomo bank ltd.     okada expects the dollar to trade between 148 and 150 yen this week but sees the chance of a drop to 140 yen by the end of april or early may.     even if west germany and japan succeed in stimulating their economies, it may not be enough to solve structural economic imbalances in the near future, dealers said.     "even if japan and west germany do expand this year, it won't be enough to help the trade situation much," said bourdain of bankamerica, who also expects the dollar to drop to 148 yen in the next couple of days.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>china's first joint venture bank, xiamen international bank (xib), reported a group net profit of about 14 mln hong kong dlrs in 1986, the bank's first full year of operation.     general manager liu shuxun declined to give a 1987 profit forecast, saying targets were under study.     assistant general manager wang hongshan said the group's outstanding loans at end-1986 totalled 620 mln hong kong dlrs, up from 530 mln at end-1985. deposits and interbank borrowings rose to 680 mln dlrs from 550 mln, he told reuters.     liu said most of the group's profit came from the parent company rather than its two wholly-owned subsidiaries xiamen international finance co ltd, in hong kong and luso international bank ltd> in macao.     the joint venture bank began operating in september 1985 but did not officially open until march 1986.     liu said the share in the joint venture of the foreign partner, hong kong-listed panin holdings ltd>, had been cut last year to 49 pct from 60 pct. this was done because foreign banks felt the xib's reputation would be improved if the three chinese partners collectively held a majority stake, he said.     liu said news reports about problems concerning panin were unfounded, but he did not elaborate. panin holdings reported a loss of 1.99 mln hong kong dlrs in 1986 after a net profit of 268,000 dlrs in 1985.     the chinese partners are industrial and commercial bank of china, fujian branch, whose share rose to 23.5 pct from 15, fujian investment and enterprise corporation 17.5 pct (15) and xiamen construction and development corporation 10 pct (10).     one foreign banker said xiamen international bank faced the same problems as foreign bank branches in trying to compete on unequal terms with state-owned banks.     the foreign banking market in xiamen is thin and almost saturated, he added.     officials of the joint venture bank said they benefitted from contacts made through its three chinese partners. but the foreign banker, who asked not to be named, said it faced internal competition from the industrial and commercial bank.     apart from xiamen international bank and the international agricultural development bank planned by the world bank and the state-owned agricultural bank of china, xiamen has eight foreign bank branches or representative offices, mostly of hong kong or overseas chinese banks.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>canada vows to fight u.s. potash action</TITLE>
<BODY>external affairs minister joe clark today vowed to do everything possible to fight the u.s. action against canadian potash exports, but also warned against raising the alarm too early in the dispute.     in the latest flashpoint in canadian-u.s. trade relations, the u.s. international trade commission ruled unanimously monday that canadian potash shipments valued at 270 million u.s. dlrs last year were injuring the u.s. industry.     "we certainly intend to do everything we can to insure that canadian interests are well protected," clark told the house of commons in the daily question period.     but he said the opposition parties should be careful "not to raise false alarms too early."     the case now goes before the u.s. commerce department's trade division to determine if a duty should be imposed. potash producers from new mexico, claiming unfair government subsidies, are seeking a 43 pct tariff on canada's shipments.     canada, the world's largest potash producer, exported 9.8 mln metric tonnes of potash last year, with nearly a third going to the u.s.     most of the potash, used in the production of fertilizer, comes from provincially owned mines in saskatchewan.     in the commons, liberal member lloyd axworthy branded the ruling as just another "trade harrassment" from the u.s. and criticized clark's assurances the country's interests would be protected.     "we received exactly the same kind of assurances in the softwood lumber case that was totally fumbled and bumbled," axworthy said.     canada's progressive conservative government agreed to impose a 15 pct duty on its softwood lumber exports earlier this year to end a long and bitter bilateral trade dispute with the u.s.     axworthy urged the government to present canada's case to world trade authorities under the general agreement on tariffs  and trade.     but clark maintained the potash dispute was another example of why canada needs to find a new way to settle bilateral irritants in the free trade negotiations under way with the u.s.     "what we are seeking to do is put in place a better system," clark said.     meanwhile, saskatchewan trade minister bob andrew expressed confidence canada would win its case, claiming the problem stems from low international commodity prices and not government subsidies.     "the reality of the problem and the injury is caused worldwide," he said. "it's caused by a downturn in the commodity price for fertilizer, whether it's potash fertilizer, nitrogen fertilizer or whatever."  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>mergers, public offers seen among car dealers</TITLE>
<BODY>automobile dealerships have become large, multi-store operations, and the largest sell more than 1 billion dlrs a year worth of vehicles a year.     around the auto industry there is talk of mergers and buyouts among dealerships, and there are rumors that the largest are considering offering shares to the public, analysts say.     retail car sales "are at a point of transition. there's not much that's off the table in terms of creative thinking" about ways to sell cars, says david cole, analyst with the university of michigan's transportation research institute.     the retail car market is "much more freeform now" than it was in 1956, the year things began to change, says detroit analyst arvid jauppi of arvid jauppi and associates.     thirty years ago, in 1956, the situation was different. dealerships sold one kind of car--a "chevy" or a ford or a studebaker. the average dealer had 17 employees and sold 738,000 dlrs worth of vehicles, according to the national automobile dealers association.     that year a tiny car from overseas--germany's volkswagen beatle--began to gain popularity. the "bug" caused "a rebellion" among dealers, who demanded greater freedom from restrictions placed on them by the major american automakers, says jauppi.     one of the most visible changes in retail car sales has been in the size of dealerships, auto analysts say. last year, the average dealership had 11.2 mln dlrs in sales--a 15-fold increase from 1956--and employed 34 workers.     "i had one of these guys tell me he makes six, seven mln dlrs a year and didn't know what to do with all his money," says cole.     "there's a whole lot more rich guys who sell cars than that make cars," he says.     with the increase in size, large dealers have been buying up other dealerships, and auto analysts see few signs the trend will let up.     donald keithley, vice president, dealer services, for j.d. power, a california-based market research firm, says that, by 1990, 12,000 people will own dealerships compared to 16,800 principal owners today.     many dealers are experimenting with owning several franchises, some of which might compete against each other. "it used to be a chevrolet dealer was a chevrolet dealer. now a chevrolet dealer might handle several lines," jauppi says.     as dealers get bigger, industry officials are talking about the possibility that some of them might become publicly-owned or open international operations.     offering shares to the public is an option large dealers, "are obviously thinking of very seriously," says cole.     although some say the franchise system might get in the way of a public offering, jauppi says there are few obstacles to trading in car dealer shares.     "dealers are large enough now to go public. the only thing the manufacturer cares about is that the dealer sells those cars. it could happen any time," jauppi says.     "if you look at the whole merger mania, and look at the scale some of these dealers, it's going to be very hard to resist taking them public," said another analyst.     and jauppi says that dealerships can be expected to become international.     "we're going to have international dealers--dealer networks that are worldwide," he says. u.s. dealers will be attracted particularly to europe, where the market will expand faster than the u.s., he says.     "it's not totally off the wall," says cole.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>texaco tx, reserves down despite lower output</TITLE>
<BODY>texaco inc's oil and gas reserves declined in 1986 despite reduced production and upward revisions in the company's previous reserve estimates, its annual report said.     the statement of the report's auditor was qualified -- as was the previous one -- because of the unkonwn final impact of the judgement won by pennzoil co pzl, against texaco on charges texaco interfered with pannzoil's contract to acquire getty oil co.     the auditor's point out, as texaco has in the past, the company's loss of any of several pending court decisions in this case could cause it "to face prospects such as having to seek protection of its assets and business pursuant to the bankruptcy and reorganization provisions of chapter 11" of the federal bankruptcy code.     commenting on a texas court of appeals ruling which reduced pennzoil's judgement by two billion dlrs, to 9.1 billion dlrs, texaco said it will file a motion for a rehearing by the appeals court no later than march 30.     texaco said the proven crude oil reserves of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries totaled 2.54 billion barrels at the end of 1986, down from 2.69 billion a year earlier.     however, inclusion of texaco's equity in the eastern hemisphere reserves of a nonsubsidiary company limited the decline to 2.91 billion barrels from 3.00 billion at the end of 1985.     worldwide production by the consolidated subsidiaries declined to 341 mln barrels last year from 362 mln in 1985 and upward revisions in previous reserve estimates rose to 143 mln barrels from 117 mln, respectively.     texaco said the largest drop in reserves came in the united states -- where the total dropped to 1.46 billion barrels from 1.55 billion.     the company said u.s. liquids production averaged 660,000 barrels per day last year, down from 714,000 in 1985, with about 44 pct of the decline -- some 24,000 barrels per day -- representing high-cost production shut-in or curtailed in response to the decline in crude oil prices during 1986.     texaco said its natural gas reserves totaled 8.16 trillion cubic feet at year end, down from 8.87 trillion cubic feet at the end of 1985.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>the price of gold bullion is likely to rise in the second half of the year on increased private investor demand, west german analysts said.     gold could rise as high as 500 dlrs per ounce later this year, said peter witte, director of westdeutsche landesbank girozentrale's trading division, after a presentation by the u.s. mint to promote its gold and silver eagle series coins.     "a lot will depend on oil prices and developments on stock exchanges," witte said, adding he saw gold positioned for further rises once it breaks out above 450 dlrs.     gold was fixed this morning in london at 411.30 dlrs.     despite current strong interest in gold mine stocks, many investors still want to buy physical gold, witte said.     interest in gold mine stocks may also wane if stock exchange rallies under way in many countries start to waver.     hermann strohmeyer, vice president of commerzbank ag's foreign exchange trading and treasury department, said gold is poised to rise to 460 to 470 dlrs an ounce in the second half of this year.     the price is unlikely to fall much below 380 or 390 dlrs an ounce, and probably will continue in a range between 380 and 430 dlrs in the first half of this year, he said.  reuter </BODY>

"the policy is proving counter-productive and rates will have to come down in the long-term," the bank spokesman said in reply to reuters enquiries.     he said higher rates were fuelling an influx of short-term speculative capital from abroad.

<TITLE>justice, dot back airline antitrust switch</TITLE>
<BODY>strong competition remains in the airline industry despite a recent wave of mergers, a transportation department official said.     but assistant transportation secretary matthew scocozza said at a senate antitrust committee hearing he would not object to a transfer of the department's authority over airline mergers to the justice department.     scocozza and deputy assistant attorney general roger andewelt said both departments felt airlines should be judged under the same antitrust standards as all other industries.     the transportation department is due to lose its authority in 1989, but subcommittee chairman howard metzenbaum wants it shifted now because he feels the department has approved too many airline mergers.     "airline mergers have proceeded at a breakneck pace with barely a whimper being uttered by the department of transportation. nine airlines control 94 per cent of the market," the ohio democrat said.     metzenbaum said he was concerned about the effects the pending u.s.-air-piedmont airlines merger would have on service, especially at dayton, ohio, a major piedmont hub.     scocozza said even with the recent mergers, such as texas air corp's acquisition of eastern air lines and people express, more airlines were flying now in the united states than before the 1978 airline deregulation act.     "airline deregulation has worked, is working, and, given the department's commitment to preserving a competitive environment, will continue to work," scocozza said.     he said the department considers the effect each merger will have on competition over all the routes involved and will not approve a merger which will reduce competition.     scocozza said most of the recent mergers involved airlines in financial difficulty being taken over by other carriers.      andewelt said he was optimistic competition would increase as airlines expanded airport hubs and routes and believed the industry did not need special treatment under antitrust laws.     "it is time to treat the airline industry in precisely the same way as other u.s. industries; any differences are not significant for the purpose of merger analysis," andewelt said.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>yen may rise to 140 to the dlr, nikkeiren says</TITLE>
<BODY>the yen could rise to 140 yen to the dollar, a leading japanese businessman said.     bumpei otsuki, president of the influential japan federation of employers' associations, (nikkeiren), told reporters: "the yen might rise as far as 140 (to the dollar). the u.s. economy is not good, and as long as the u.s. economy is not good, the u.s. will put various pressures (on japan)."     "the yen's level depends on the condition of the u.s. economy rather than japan's economy, and as long as the american situation is bad, the yen will continue to rise," he said.     to cope with the negative impact of the strong yen, japanese enterprises must strive to cut costs by all means, including holding down wages as much as possible, otsuki said.     he rejected recent calls from some government quarters for wage increases this year as a means of raising private consumption and thus boosting domestic demand.     "we have to keep wages as low as possible," he said.     he also said the yen's large and rapid rise is depressing the outlook for the japanese economy, noting that in addition to hurting exporters it is also damaging domestic market manufacturers through cheap imports.     parts of the service sector are also threatened, otsuki said.     tertiary industries provide services to manufacturers and a downturn in manufacturing profits will adversely affect service industries, he said.     it is also doubtful whether the tertiary sector can fully employ those put out of work in the manufacturing sector, he said.     profits of service sector companies are likely to fall in the business year ending in march 1988, leading to a possible recession in the japanese economy, he said.     otsuki said economic growth is unlikely to pick up beyond levels experienced in 1986.     the government's economic planning agency said last week the economy grew at 2.5 pct in 1986, the worst performance since 1974 when the economy shrank 1.4 pct due to the first oil price crisis.     in order to stimulate domestic demand and boost the economy, tax reforms aimed at bringing down the cost of land and reforming the nation's housing stock are needed, along with steps to bring down the high cost of commodities, he said.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>abu dhabi to reopen gulf oilfield hit in 1986 raid</TITLE>
<BODY>abu dhabi's offshore abu al-bukhoosh oilfield in the gulf, shut since an aerial attack last november, will reopen when new anti-aircraft defences are ready, and this could be in the next two months, oil industry sources said.     they said the abu dhabi government and compagnie francaise des petroles (total) tpn.pa,, whose total abu al-bukhoosh subsidiary owns 51 pct of the field, have agreed on the reopening, but that a date has not been definitely fixed.     unidentified planes hit the field, 100 miles off abu dhabi, last november 25.     the raid killed eight workers and destroyed the main living quarters and a bridge linking a wellhead to the main production platform.     western diplomats in the region say iran was responsible but tehran has blamed its gulf war enemy iraq.     abu al-bukhoosh was producing 57,000 barrels per day (bpd) at the time of the attack, but the sources said it would resume at a maximum of half that level because of reduced staff and the fact only four of five wellheads were now operable.     the sources said only 80 personnel can be housed in remaining accomodations, the sources said.     facilities being installed to protect the field include aircraft detection equipment, anti-aircraft missiles, housing for military personnel and helicopter landing pads, the sources said.     abu dhabi is the largest oil producer in the united arab emirates, accounting for about 800,000 bpd of its total 1.15 mln bpd production, the sources said.     they also said iran was working to reopen its sassan field, part of the same reservoir as abu al-bukhoosh and located only a few miles away. sassan was heavily damaged by an iraqi air raid only 10 days before abu al-bukhoosh was attacked.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>u.s. corn acreage seen near record low</TITLE>
<BODY>u.s. corn acreage this year is  likely to drop to the lowest level since the unsurpassed acreage reductions of the 1983 pik year and could rank as one of the lowest corn plantings in the united states in sixty years, agriculture department officials said.     usda releases its official plantings report on march 31. agriculture department analysts said next week's figures will likely show a sharp drop in acreage to as low as 65 mln acres, down 22 pct from last year's plantings of 83.3 mln acres.     assuming an 18 mln acre drop in plantings, u.s. corn production will also decrease significantly. analysts said 1987 corn production could drop by over one billion bushels to around seven billion bushels.     expected signup of up to 90 pct in the 1987 feed grains program, along with 1.9 mln acres enrolled in the conservation program, will cause acreage to plummet, department feedgrain analysts said.     "there's no question that there will be a sharp decrease in corn acreage," one said. "it's difficult for any farmer to not go along with the program this year."     soybean acreage is also expected to decline this year but at a much slower rate of around four pct, usda analysts said.     soybean plantings could drop to 59 mln acres or below, they said, compared to last year's level of 61.5 mln acres.     if analysts' unofficial estimates prove correct then the drop in u.s. corn acreage will be the largest since 1983 when farmers idled 22 mln acres in the payment-in-kind program.     farmers planted only around 60 mln acres of corn in 1983. a severe drought that summer in major producing states caused yields to tumble and final crop production to total only 4.2 billion bushels.     given normal weather conditions this year, usda analysts said the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billion bushels, down from last year's crop of 8.3 billion bushels.     "this kind of acreage reduction will mean a significant reduction in production," an analyst said.     a crop of seven billion bushels is close to the annual u.s. corn usage, so surplus stocks, while not decreasing, would not increase significantly, a specialist said.     high producing corn belt states are expected to show the greatest acreage reductions, based upon historical participation in government programs, analysts said.     in contrast, soybean acreage is likely to be cut the most in marginal producing areas of the southeast and the western corn belt, a usda soybean analyst said.     "soybean acreage in the eastern corn belt will not budge," he said. neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts in higher-producing delta areas.     soybean production could drop fractionally from last year's 2.0 billion bushels to 1.8 to 1.9 billion, he said.     u.s. soybean acreage, after soaring to 71.4 mln acres in 1979 from only 52 mln acres five years prior to that, has steadily declined in the 1980's.     u.s. corn acreage, with the exception of 1983, has been in the low to mid 80-mln acre range for the past 10 years. the highest corn plantings reported in the 60 years that usda has kept such records was in 1932 when farmers planted 113 mln acres and obtained average yields of 26.5 bushels per acre.     last year u.s. farmers obtained record corn yields averaging 119.3 bushels per acre.     "we have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billion bushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so," an analyst said.     corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres as long as government program provisions remain the same, analysts said.     currently farmers enrolling in the program are required to set aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligible for payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15 pct of their acreage.     "to get to the pik level of 60 mln acres, we would have to provide more incentives," an analyst said.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>american eagle gold bullion coin sales are projected at 3.1 mln troy ounces in their first year on the market, well above the target of 2.2 mln, donna pope, director of the u.s. mint, told journalists.     world sales, which began on october 20, 1986, reached 2.193 mln ounces in less than six months of sales. this made it world market leader with a share of 37 pct in 1986, pope said.     pope said that in volume terms, nearly half of all gold eagle sales were within north america, roughly 40 pct were in europe and about eight pct in asia.     she said despite introduction of several new gold bullion coins on the market recently, the mint is aiming to preserve the eagle's strong market share with extensive publicity.     the mint uses mainly newly mined u.s. gold for the coins, as long as this is available at market prices. the remaining gold is taken either from u.s. treasury stocks, or from the open market, pope said.     gold analysts said the eagle is facing competition here from the canadian maple leaf, and also to a lesser extent from the south african krugerrand. some estimated the maple leaf's west german market share at 60 pct.     the figures may be distorted, as many german investors buy gold bullion in switzerland or luxembourg to escape the 14 pct value-added tax imposed here. including the tax, the one-ounce coins traded today at 906 marks, they said.     competition may also come from new gold coins, including belgium's ecu, which began sales today. britain and australia also have plans to mint gold bullion coins, the analysts said.  reuter </BODY>

"i spent four years and two weeks in the white house job  refusing to comment on personnel matters," he said in an interview with the cable news network.

<TITLE>china says 1986 budget deficit 7.08 billion yuan</TITLE>
<BODY>china posted a budget deficit of 7.08 billion yuan in 1986, the fourth highest since 1949, after a surplus of 2.82 billion in 1985, finance minister wang bingqian told the national people's congress.     he put 1986 revenue at 222.03 billion yuan, against a budgeted 214.17 billion, and up from 185.41 billion in 1985, and expenditure at 229.11 billion, against a budgeted 214.17 billion and 182.59 billion in 1985.     official figures show the record post-1949 budget deficit was 17 billion yuan in 1979.     wang said the 1986 deficit was due to excess capital construction and administrative expenses and unjustified and extravagant investments outside the state plan.     he also blamed the inefficiency of firms whose production costs and losses rose. he said subsidising state firms' losses cost 32.25 billion yuan. the 1985 budget did not give a separate figure for this.     he said the processing industry developed too fast and some projects could not start operations because of power shortages, while too many non-productive facilities were set up.     wang said 1986 and 1985 investment in fixed assets rose 15.3 pct and 41.8 pct respectively year on year and consumption funds rose 12.5 pct and 23.7 pct, outstripping the growth in national income.     wang said revenues were affected by the steep fall in world oil prices, the decline in the price of primary products, a drop in income from customs duties and the rising cost of earning foreign exchange through exports.     revenue also fell because the state raised the rate of depreciation for fixed assets of certain state firms, reduced their regulatory tax and made other tax cuts for firms.     wang said 1986 tax receipts rose to 206.45 billion yuan from 201.82 billion in 1985, state treasury bond receipts to 6.2 billion from 6.04 billion and receipts from foreign loans rose to 7.87 billion from 2.5 billion.     he said 1986 budgetary spending on capital construction rose to 65.57 billion yuan from 56.97 billion in 1985, on technical renovation and new products to 12.62 billion from 10.05 billion, aid to rural production and other farm expenses to 12.03 billion from 10.16 billion, culture, science, education and public health to 38 billion from 31.72 billion and defence to 20.13 billion from 19.15 billion.      wang said expenditure for repaying principal and interest on foreign loans in 1986 was 3.4 billion yuan, up from 3.26 billion in 1985.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>monetary authorities said to lose credibility</TITLE>
<BODY>the monetary authorities of the major industrialised countries lost their credibility this week as the dollar was sold off despite pleas from ministers and widespread central bank intervention, dealers said.     the dollar's fall below 150 yen, which follows last month's paris currency stabilisation agreement by the u.s., japan, west germany, britain, france and canada, is a dramatic reversal of the success of the group of five (g-5) 1985 new york plaza meeting to weaken the dollar, they said.     the g-5 and the market agreed in 1985 that the dollar was overvalued but this time the market and the authorities are on different sides, dealers said.     apparent confusion in the ranks of the g-5 nations has encouraged the market to challenge the authorities despite concerted intervention by the central banks of the united states, japan, britain and west germany, they said.     pleas by japanese finance minister kiichi miyazawa for action to stabilise the dollar were matched over the weekend by comments by u.s. treasury secretary james baker that there was no target zone for the dollar. the dollar was sold anyway.     yesterday's comment by baker that he stood by the paris accord did nothing to reverse sentiment, dealers said.     the intervention, backed by remarks by fed chairman paul volcker and japanese central bank governor satoshi sumita, which a few months ago would have brought the dollar fall to a halt, has done little but slow the rate of its decline, they noted.     the situation has again raised the question of whether intervention can succeed against the trend in today's huge currency markets. dealers said the market's cool response to intervention reflected a basic oversupply of dollars.     "this means that the current dollar selling is not of a sheer speculative nature but backed by real demand," said koichi miyazaki, deputy general manager at sanwa bank.     dealers said the dollar will remain weak despite the intervention and it is only a matter of time before some operators try to push it below 148 yen. the dollar closed in tokyo today at 149.40 against new york's 149.30/40. its record low was 148.40 in tokyo last tuesday.     dealers said the dollar will gain only temporary support to rise above 150 yen toward early april when the group of seven industrial nations meets to discuss currencies again.     the market expects the seven nations (the paris six plus italy) to try to agree on another way to stabilise currencies apart from intervention, a chief dealer at a u.s. bank said.     dealers said they were unsure what other methods could be used and they are sceptical anyway about how long the paris accord nations, particulary the u.s., will remain willing to prevent a further dollar fall given the continuing high u.s. trade deficit, especially with japan.     further pressure from a protectionist u.s. congress for a lower dollar is also limiting washington's options, they said.     the market now thinks the central bank action is to slow the dollar fall, not to push it back over 150 yen, said tadahiko nashimoto, manager at long term credit bank of japan.     another bearish factor for the dollar is expected large forward dollar sales from april to june for export bills falling due for japanese exporters from april to september.     the exporters had delayed in expectation of a further yen depreciation, dealers said.     yesterday's request to 30 trading houses by the ministry of international trade and industry to restrict dollar sales looks ineffective in light of this real demand, they said.     the market is also anticipating active institutional dollar sales to hedge currency risks on bond holdings from the new business year starting april 1, dealers said.     "the market seems to have established a new dollar trading range between 147 and 149 yen," one dealer said.     the dollar traded between 151 and 153 yen after the paris accord on february 22 and 150 yen was then considered the low end for the dollar against the yen, he said.     some dealers now believe that if the dollar falls below 148 yen, it will pick up renewed downward momentum and slide to 145.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>jardine matheson profits seen up sharply in 1986</TITLE>
<BODY>a strong performance by its retail businesses and affiliates will enable jardine matheson holdings ltd jard.hkg, to report on friday a big leap in net profit in 1986, stock analysts said.     they told reuters they expect the firm to show earnings of between 420 mln and 450 mln h.k. dlrs last year against 157 mln in 1985.     the analysts also said they expect jardine matheson to pay a total dividend of 15 to 20 cents a share against 10 cents a share in 1985.     james capel (far east) ltd estimates jardine matheson's 1986 profits at 450 mln dlrs and attributes most of the income to retail sales.     analysts said the group's 7-eleven retail stores and its franchises, among them canon cameras, christian dior luxury goods and mercedes benz cars, produced a strong cash flow.     alan hargreaves of hoare govett asia ltd also put jardine matheson's 1986 net profits at 450 mln dlrs and said he estimates pre-tax earnings from retail operations at about 465 mln dlrs against 339 mln in 1985.     but hargreaves said jardine matheson's earnings from its 35 pct stake in hong kong land co ltd hkld.hkg> will fall to about 230 mln dlrs from 281 mln dlrs in 1985.     the reduced contribution reflects the spin-off from hong kong land of dairy farm international ltd> last september.     jardine gained a direct holding of 35 pct of dairy farm as a result of the spin-off. analysts said jardine will book revenues from its dairy farm stake for the final months of the year as part of its retail business, which will increase its overall retail income figures.     analysts said jardine matheson will also enjoy sharply increased revenues from financial services, mainly its 50 pct share of jardine fleming holdings ltd>.     jardine fleming yesterday reported record profits for 1986 of 209.5 mln dlrs against 104.7 mln in 1985.     analysts said jardine matheson made net interest payments of about 200 mln dlrs last year, slightly below the 213 mln dlrs of 1985, while the company's term debt remained at about the 1985 level of 2.7 billion dlrs.     but jardine was also subject to increased taxes of 340 mln dlrs last year against 292 mln in 1985, they said.     jardine matheson is undergoing a series of reorganisations that will in effect turn it into a holding company for its diverse interests.     it previously announced a plan to sell its stakes in both hong kong land and dairy farm to newly created jardine strategic holdings ltd> in which it has a 41 pct interest.     a company statement issued last month said the firm will use the proceeds to repay all debt, leaving it with an additional 500 mln dlrs in cash on hand.     though jardine matheson will be deprived of a direct stake in the high-yield hong kong land and dairy farm units, it is likely to develop its own business, analysts said.     "the future of the stock will depend on the firm's ability to creatively structure some new acquisitions," said hargreaves of hoare govett.     he noted the firm has suggested financial services as a key sector, and he said it may add some insurance firms to its existing business.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>anchor glass container corp said first quarter net income is now expected to exceed the 3.1 mln dlrs earned before extraordinary items in the year earlier quarter.     previously, the company had said first quarter results would likely be lower than for the 1986 period due to production disruptions caused by the large number of production line changes scheduled during the first quarter, its statement pointed out.     while the disruptive effects of the production line changes had occurred in line with expectations, anchor glass said, first quarter operating results were helped by lower than anticipated operating costs and improved margins on sales as a result of a more favorable product mix.     the company said its income performance for the full year remains very good.     it also said anchor hocking corp arh, has converted the entire principal balance of its anchor glass convertible subordinated note to 576,694 anchor glass common shares.     anchor glass said the conversion decreased its total debt and increased stockholders' equity by about 9.4 mln dlrs and increased common shares outstanding to 13,902,716.     it said the conversion will also reduce its annualized net interest expense by about 1.1 mln dlrs, or 600,000 dlrs after taxes.  reuter </BODY>

"i don't think anyone believes we'll meet the 108 billion dlr target," lyng told the virginia farm bureau.     lyng is believed to be the first top administration official to publicly express doubts the target would be met.     the remark was quickly disavowed by the white house office of management and budget (omb). "his 'no one' does not include the omb," said spokesman edwin dale.     lyng made the remark while describing the need for the agriculture sector to share the burden of cutbacks under last year's gramm-rudman law.     "there needs to be some reduction of some expenditures to at least get close to the gramm-rudman figure," he said. "agriculture would not be independent from that."      lyng's special assistant, floyd gabler, said the remark was an opinion based on lyng's discussions with congressmen.

<TITLE>ferc decision could cut columbia gas cg, net</TITLE>
<BODY>columbia gas system inc said a federal energy regulatory commission decision today on natural gas cost recovery could reduce its 1987 earnings by about 1.25 dlrs a share.     the company said "this could bring earnings for 1987 below columbia's stated goal of earning no less than its 3.18 dlrs per share dividend." it earned 2.12 dlrs a share in 1986.     it said management expects to recommend to the board that the dividend rate be maintained in 1987.     columbia gas said the impact of the ferc decision may be offset by a one-time accounting change rleated to future tax liabilities under the new federal tax laws.     the company recorded these liabilities based on older, higher tax rates, but an action being considered by the financial accounting standards board could result in a gain of about 1.20 dlrs a share in 1987, it explained.     "thus there is a good chance that we will attain our 1987 earnings goal -- although not in the way originally planned," columbia gas said.     columbia gas said the ferc decision would limit the recovery of certain gas contract costs by columbia gas transmission corp, the company's principal pipeline subsidiary.     it said the decision specifically excluded from a purchased gas adjustment filing by the pipeline costs related to amortizing payments made to producers to reform gas purchase contracts. these were excluded on the grounds the subsidiary failed to sufficiently support cost recovery.     the company said its subsidiary is not precluded from making a new filing to provide sufficient support.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>canada sets oil industry aid package</TITLE>
<BODY>canada's federal government will provide a 350 mln dlr oil industry aid package that includes cash incentives designed to cover one-third of a company's oil and gas exploration and development costs, energy minister marcel masse announced.     the aid program will inject about 350 mln dlrs a year into the oil and gas industry and could lead to more than one billion dlrs in new investment, masse told a news conference.     the program will affect drilling done anywhere in canada on or after april 1, 1987.     masse told reporters that the government's oil industry aid package is aimed at small and medium sized companies.     the aid package, called the canadian exploration and development incentive program, will restrict the total payments that any individual company can claim to 10 mln dlrs a year.     masse said the program will probably generate new employment equivalent to 20,000 people working for a year.     he said oil industry aid is needed because exploration and development spending dropped by at least 50 pct since world oil prices fell during the first half of 1986.     energy minister masse said the federal government decided to provide cash incentives so a large number of non-tax paying companies, mainly small canadian firms, will receive the full value of the incentive. such companies would not immediately benefit from tax benefits, he said.     the federal government also wanted to deliver an aid program outside the tax system. finance minister michael wilson is now reviewing canada's tax system and plans to announce tax reform proposals later this spring.     an important feature of the aid program is a decision to let companies issue flow-through shares, allowing investors to benefit from the subsidy rather than restricting benefits to only participating companies, he said.     allowing flow-through shares under the program will make it easier for companies to attract investors in exploration and development, masse said.     he told reporters his department is still considering whether to allow partnerships and other entities to qualify for the subsidy.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>china should tighten imports of ordinary goods and restrict or even forbid import of goods which can be made domestically, premier zhao ziyang said.     he told the national people's congress, china's parliament, that the country's foreign exchange is limited and must be used where it is most needed. "we should expand production of import substitutes and increase their proportion," he said. on exports, china should increase its proportion of manufactured goods, especially textiles, light industrial goods, electronics and machinery, he said.     zhao said china should lower the cost of exports and control the export of goods that incur too much loss.     zhao said china should work to provide a more favourable investment environment for foreign businessmen.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>inspectorate issues 200 mln mark equity eurobond</TITLE>
<BODY>a unit of inspectorate international ag insz.z, is raising 200 mln marks through an equity warrant eurobond package with a two pct coupon priced at par, lead manager schweizerische bankverein (deutschland) ag said.     the five-year bond, for inspectorate international finance nv, gives investors options on two separate warrant series "a" and "b" exercisable into participation certificates in parent and guarantor inspectorate international ag.     the first "a" series carries warrants for four participation certificates. upon exercising the "a" warrants, investors also get two warrants for the "b" series.     the "a" exercise period runs from may 7, 1987, to august 6, 1987. the exercise price is 543 swiss francs.     of the two "b" warrants, one entitles investors to purchase one participation certificate in inspectorate international ag and the other provides seven warrants.     investors may pay for "b" participation certificates by redeeming the bond issued today. in this case, the bond, issued in denominations of 5,000 marks, will be valued at a fixed price of 4,200 swiss francs, or 119.05 francs per 100 marks.     participation certificates acquired with "b" warrants will be priced at 597 francs, equalling the price of the first tranche, plus a 10 pct premium. the exercise period for the "b" series is from august 8, 1987 to may 5, 1991.     fees for the bond total 2-1/4 pct, with 1-1/2 points for selling, and 1-3/4 for management and underwriting combined.     investors will pay for the bond on april 8, and the bond pays annual interest on the same day. it matures on april 8, 1992. the bond and warrants will be listed in frankfurt.     if all participation share warrants are exercised, the company will obtain some 300 mln marks in new equity.     the construction allows inspectorate to borrow at lower cost than a comparable convertible bond and will give the inspectorate equity through issues of participation certificates in west germany, a swiss bank corp spokesman said.     inspectorate requires funding to finance its purchase of a 51 pct stake in harpener ag, a diversified west german group, and other recent acquisitions.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>colombia plans to maintain foreign borrowing at levels similar to the 1982-86 period, during which it received a net 1.3 billion dlrs net of repayments, finance minister cesar gaviria said.     he told the inter-american development bank (iadb) annual meeting here that despite latin america's debt crisis, colombia continues to achieve positive credit flows reflecting the strength of its economy that grew five pct last year.     public credit director mauricio cabrera said colombia plans to launch a foreign bond issue in the second half of 1987, possibly for 60 mln dlrs.     cabrera said a 50 mln dlr floating rate note (frn) issue by colombia is expected to close next month. it carries a 1-1/8 pct margin over libor, with a seven year maturity and four years grace.     he also told reuters he did not expect any increase in colombia's financing needs as a result of current falling coffee prices, after a surge last year doubled export income from this source to around three billion dlrs.     "the drop will simply bring us back to 1985 levels, with a loss of no more than about 100 mln dlrs," he said.     colombia, with a total foreign debt of around 13 billion dlrs, has a foreign borrowing programme of around three billion dlrs this year, of which about one billion is new credits.     its foreign reserves ended 1986 at 3.5 billion dlrs, equivalent to more than nine months of imports and non-financial services, and gdp growth is again expected to reach five pct this year, gaviria said.   reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>no pessimism for german exporters, ministry</TITLE>
<BODY>firms need not be pessimistic about export prospects even though foreign markets have become more difficult because of the mark's strength the economics ministry said.      the ministry's parliamentary state secretary ludolf georg von wartenberg, told a business conference german exports could start rising again in real terms during 1987, reversing the lower export trend which emerged in mid-1986.     but even if the turnaround did not occur, there would be no need to worry about the economy as long as the weakness of exports did not affect currently good domestic demand.     von wartenberg said consumer demand remained quite good but noted there had been a cooling in the investment climate. "this is certainly a reason for heightened watchfulness but not for stimulative steps," he said.     the best way for bonn to help its exporters is to work actively to promote free world trade, he added.     von wartenberg said the economy still had good export opportunities. price alone was not the only factor in international competitiveness, he said, adding german firms have a reputation for high quality standards, prompt delivery times and good service.     von wartenberg said the government was in a difficult position on its trade figures.  it faced international pressure to reduce its trade surplus, but west germans were worried about the effect of the mark's strength on the country's exporters.     reports about the trade surplus, especially overseas, tended to concentrate on nominal trade figures, which rose to a record 112.2 billion marks in 1986, he said. but this rise was due entirely to the lower value of imports caused by the decline of both the dollar and oil prices. german exports have in fact been falling in real terms for sometime, he said.  reuter </BODY>

"simply stabilizing prices at about 18 dlrs per barrel     will not materialy slow the drop in u.s. production or the rise in imports," chairman fred hartley said in the annual report.

<TITLE>argentine soybean yield estimates down further</TITLE>
<BODY>argentine grain producers again reduced their estimates for the total yield of the 1986/87 soybean crop, which will begin to be harvested in mid-april, trade sources said.     they said growers now forecast soybean production this season at between 7.5 and 7.8 mln tonnes, down from last week's estimate of 7.7 to eight mln tonnes and the 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes forecast in mid-february.     the new forecast is still higher than last season's record total production.     private sources put 1985/86 production at a record 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes -- 4.2 to 6.4 pct lower than the new forecast for the current crop. the official figure for 1985/86 is 7.1 mln tonnes, 5.6 to 9.9 pct below this season's new estimates.     growers in the past week discovered more empty soybean pods in the main producing areas of southern cordoba and santa fe provinces and northern buenos aires.     the crop since january has been hit by high temperatures and inadequate rainfall. growers fear they may find more empty pods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield.     the area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct higher than the 1985/86 record of 3.34 mln hectares.     the state of the crop continued to be good in general until last week but intense, heavy rains since could have caused damage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm.     where the rains were less heavy they were considered beneficial although too late to improve yield estimates.     the rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops in southern buenos aires province but are not expected to influence production forecasts.     in other areas, especially western buenos aires, where rainfall was more than 200 mm, parts of the sunflower, maize and sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged.     the coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week by rains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of cordoba, la pampa and santa fe and almost 90 mm in parts of entre rios.     the area sown with maize this season was between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares in 1985/86.     the yield of 1986/87 maize continued to be forecast at between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes.     this estimate is 19.8 to 20.2 pct lower than the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes at which private sources put 1985/86 production and 21.1 to 22.7 pct lower than the official 12.8 mln tonnes.     the sunflowerseed harvest has covered 23 to 26 pct of the area sown and continues in parts of central buenos aires although at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods.     a resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage is impossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to 10 days of sunshine dries the fields.     the area sown this season was 2.0 to 2.2 mln hectares, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct on last year's record 3.14 mln hectares.     sunflowerseed 1986/87 production is still forecast at 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes, 34.1 to 41.5 pct below the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln tonnes.     the grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by the rains, advancing steadily in santa fe and cordoba and starting in la pampa to cover 14 to 16 pct of the total area sown.     the area sown was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares the previous season.     yield estimates remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes, 16.7 to 22 pct down on 1985/86 production of 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>utilicorp united corp said it expects to report 1987 first quarter earnings of about 12 mln dlrs or about 1.12 dlrs a share and revenues of about 190 mln dlrs.     in the comparable quarter a year ago, utilicorp earned 8.5 mln dlrs or 87 cts on revenues of 203 mln dlrs.     there are 9.6 mln shares outstanding this year, up from the 8.5 mln shares in 1986, utilicorp's president richard green told financial analysts here.     first quarter 1987 results include one month contribution of west virginia power, which became a division on march 1, 1987, green said in remarks prepared for delivery to analysts.     higher earnings for the period reflected reduced operating and maintenenace expenses and about 10 mln dlrs in rate increases in iowa, minnesota, kansas and colorado, he said.     however, utilicorp's missouri public service division is experiencing the effect of a 5.9 pct rate reduction authorized in september 1986, he noted.     of utilicorp's total revenues expected for the 1987 first quarter, about 43 mln dlrs will be derived from electric operations and about 147 mln dlrs will come from gas operations, he said.     operating income derived from electric operations in the first three months of 1987 is estimated to be eight mln dlrs, while the contribution from gas operations will be about 10 mln dlrs, green said.     green told analysts that utilicorp received regulatory approval from various states and the federal energy regulatory commission to reincorporate in delaware, effective april one.     utilicorp signed an agreement with cominco ltd of vancouver to extend the deadline to may 31, 1987, for completion of the company's purchase of west kootenay power and light of british columbia, due to a longer than expected regulatory approval process, he said.     hearings were completed in february and a decision by the british columbia utilities commission on the 60 mln dlrs purchase by utilicorp is pending, he said.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>libya abandons chad stronghold after defeats</TITLE>
<BODY>libyan troops are hastily evacuating their last important stronghold in northern chad, leaving the key desert oasis undefended against advancing chad government troops, military and diplomatic sources said.     they said a libyan force of some 3,000 men was abandoning the oasis of faya-largeau but added that severe sand storms across chad could be delaying the pull out and an expected government strike on the town.     swirling clouds of sand, which have closed the capital of n'djamena to commercial flights for two days, have sharply reduced visibility and made it difficult to determine the exact situation around faya, french military officials said.     the hurried libyan evacuation, which started yesterday morning, follows the capture on sunday of libya's best-defended and vitally important air base at ouadi doum, 145 kms (90 miles) northeast of faya.     the fall of ouadi doum, which chad said cost 1,269 libyan lives, deprived libya of its only hard surface runway in chad capable of taking soviet-made bombers and transport planes and left faya-largeau isolated and encircled by government troops.     libyan forces are reported to have blown up stocks of fuel and ammunition on tuesday night before starting to flee northwards towards the tibesti mountain region, which adjoins libya's southern border.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>cyclops cyl, says dixons appointees resign</TITLE>
<BODY>cyclops corp said the three members of its board appointed last week by dixons group plc, had resigned and that it named three cyclops executives to replace them.     cyclops said the moves followed the announcement earlier today by dixons that it received only 20 pct of cyclops outstanding common stock under an extended tender offer that expired yesterday.     dixons initially ended its 90.25 dlr a share tender offer on march 17 after receiving 54 pct of cyclops shares.     however, the securities and exchange commission last friday pressed dixons to reopen the offer because the u.k.-based company had dropped a condition that at least 80 pct of cyclops stock be tendered by the close of the offer.     dixons then extended the offer until yesterday and earlier today indicated that a substantial number of tendered cyclops shares had been withdrawn, leaving it with only 852,000 shares, or just over 20 pct of the roughly 4.26 mln cyclops shares outstanding.     dixons said today that it purchased the tendered shares, which, when combined with the shares it already holds, gives it a 21.7 pct stake in cyclops.     cyclops said its reconstituted board includes the three newly named directors and five outside directors, all of whom were on the board prior to dixons tender offer.     the three cyclops directors were replaced by dixons appointees on march 17 under an agreement reached between the two companies.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>u.s treasury's mulford reaffirms g-6 agreement</TITLE>
<BODY>treasury assistant secretary david mulford reaffirmed u.s. backing for the paris agreement among six industrial nations to cooperate closely to foster exchange rate stability around current levels.     in testimony prepared for delivery before a senate banking subcommittee, mulford said there was broad recognition in paris that "further substantial exchange rate shifts could damage growth and adjustment prospects."     but he also said while there are clear understandings among the countries regarding cooperation, "we have refrained from establishing a system of target zones or ranges."     mulford also said the six nations have not spelled out the way in which they intend to deal with possible market developments.     he said governments must retain flexibility in dealing with exchange market pressures and efforts to establish rigid exchange rate objectives "or to specify too precisely the goals of intervention" would hurt official attempts to react to market pressures, he said.     accordingly, mulford said setting specific currency objectives and intervention to achieve those objectives would be counterproductive.     commenting on the trade deficit, mulford reiterated the treasury position that the current account deficit will decline from 148 billion dlrs last year to around 130 billion dlrs this year, due to the exchange rate adjustments of the past 18 months.     but he added trade imbalances would also be corrected by commitments from west germany and japan to stimulate their economies and by u.s. efforts to cut the budget deficit and enhance u.s. competitiveness.     he also said some newly industrialized countries should let their currencies appreciate.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>energy/u.s. oil output</TITLE>
<BODY>energy secretary john herrington has proposed several ways to boost u.s. oil production, but he said all would cost the treasury money and will come under close white house scrutiny before action is taken.     one measure he said he favored would raise the depletion allowance to 27.5 pct on new oil and gas production as well as production using enhanced extraction methods.     herrington said such a plan would cost 200 mln dlrs a year. the white house, reacting, said it did not favor amending the tax code, but would look at the proposal.     herrington's proposals to spur production were made along with the release last week of the energy department's report on energy and the national security.     the report said u.s. oil imports, rapidly rising, could hit 50 pct by the mid 1990s and have potentially damaging implications for national security.     he has said since in speeches and at news conferences that any plan he would back to spur lagging domestic oil production would have to meet three criteria--increase production, not cause economic dislocation, and be low cost to the taxpayer.     herrington said an import fee would meet the first test, spurring production but fail the second and third.     he said it would raise production and return 120,000 oil  workers to their jobs, but at the same time it lifted oil prices, the higher prices would cost 400,000 jobs nationwide and cut the gross national product by 32 billion dlrs.     a tax on gasoline, he said, would fail the first criteria by not increasing domestic production.     in any case, u.s. officials say, president reagan remains firmly opposed to an import fee and a gasoline tax.     options which meet herrington's criteria include:     - loan-price guarantees to shield banks from defaults by borrowers because of lower oil prices. it was estimated that if oil fell to five dlrs a barrel it could trigger defaults that could cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs.     - a five pct tax credit for exploration and development. it would raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325,000 barrels a day, at a cost of 740 mln dlrs a year.     - a five pct credit only for geological and geophysical expenditures. it would increase production by 80,000 barrels a day, at a cost of 65 mln dlrs.     - lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage to spur exploration. a drop from the present 150 dlrs per acre for the typical 5,760 acre tract to 25 dlrs per acre would lower the cost of the standard tract lease to 144,000 dlrs.     herrington also pressed anew for existing administration proposals to deregulate natural gas, which he said would cut the need for imported oil by 300,000 barrels daily.     he also called again for congressional approval to explore off the continental shelf, which may hold more than 12 billion barrels of oil, and the arctic national wildlife refuge, which may hold nine billion barrels.     herrington said he understood the reagan's reluctance to  amend the newly enacted tax code to fund some of these proposals, but added he hoped his department's energy/security study would make a strong case for the need to help the struggling domestic oil industry.     another move herrington said he will press anew, even though it had been rejected earlier by the white house, is to raise the fill-rate for the strategic petroleum reserve to 100,000 barrels a day from its planned 1988 rate of 35,000.     this, he said, would further bolster national security in case of an oil-supply disruption.      reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>new capital rules would favor first interstate</TITLE>
<BODY>first interstate bancorp i, would benefit from new banking capital adequacy rules proposed by the federal reserve board, chairman joseph pinola said.     "we are one of the few banks that would have an improved position," pinola said in an interview, noting first interstate has fewer off balance sheet liabilities than many other banks.     under the proposed rules, a bank's minimum capital requirement would be determined by the assessed risk of their assets, including off balance sheet liabilities that are not currently taken into account.     currently, banks must retain a primary capital ratio of 5.5 pct.     first interstate reported a primary capital ratio of 6.14 pct at the end of 1986.     pinola said first interstate has since raised that ratio, however, to about 6.70 pct, through a recent preferred stock offering and a 200-mln-dlr subordinated capital note offering announced yesterday.     first interstate reported a relatively average return on assets ratio of 0.68 at the end of 1986.     pinola said first interstate's return on assets ratio will improve to the 0.70-0.71 range at the end of the first quarter, because 1986 year-end assets, at 55.4 billion dlrs, were overestimated by about two billion dlrs.     he said he is anxious to improve the return on assets ratio further, but continued loan losses at first interstate's rocky mountain state banks continue to hold down profits.     pinola said its banks in other states are showing excellent return on asset ratios, with its arizona and washington banks running at about 1.30, its oregon bank showing 1.00 and its california bank at about 0.83.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>philippine debt talks proceed with narrower focus</TITLE>
<BODY>the latest round of talks between philippine officials and the country's commercial bank creditors on the rescheduling of 9.4 billion dlrs worth of debt are still proceeding, but with a narrower focus, philippine finance secretary jaime ongpin said.     he told a press briefing wednesday that manila has dropped a two-tier interest payment offer, which would have given banks a higher return if they took partial payment in new philippine investment notes (pins) instead of in cash.     "the pins proposal has been laid aside.... the discussion is now on pricing (of just the cash payments)," he said.     foreign banking sources in manila said on tuesday that the philippines had raised its basic interest rate offer to 7/8 over the london interbank offered rate (libor) but ongpin would not discuss details of the pricing negotiations.     he also refused to speculate on when an overall agreement might be reached. the talks have been going on for more than three weeks.     manila originally offered to pay interest in cash at 5/8 over libor or in a mixture of cash and pins -- tradeable, dollar-denominated, zero coupon notes that could potentially yield up to one point over libor.     the pins option was subsequently modified to guarantee at least a 7/8 point spread over libor but many bankers still had grave reservations, seeing it as a possible precedent for other large debtors to avoid paying interest in cash.     the pins proposal has now been left on the table as a separate option for those banks, which might want to fund their own investments in the philippines or sell the notes in the secondary market, ongpin said.     under manila's plan, the pins would be redeemable at full face value in philippine pesos to fund local equity investments at any time prior to their six-year maturity date.     while the commercial banks had their doubts about the pins proposal, ongpin said there was great interest on the part of certain investment banks which are already active in the secondary market for sovereign debt.     unlike current debt/equity schemes, ongpin said, the pins would include no government fees and would be free from "administrative hassles."     he said about six investment banks had been approached and four had replied so far. one even showed interest in buying 45 mln dlrs worth of notes, he said.     ongpin said that by funding current interest payments in the secondary market through the pins scheme, the philippines could conserve at least one to 1.5 billion dlrs of foreign exchange reserves during its planned seven-year restructuring period.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>brazil suggests 60-day short-term credit extension</TITLE>
<BODY>brazil today suggested to its foreign bank creditors an extension of short-term credit lines for 60 days until may 31, a spokesman for the central bank said.     he said that with the move, called a "standstill" arrangement, brazil was only trying to avoid difficulties in paying its 109 billion dlrs of debt in the future.     the spokesman told reuters that brazil's suggestion will be communicated by telex to brazil's 700 bank creditors. he declined to give details of the statement, but said central bank president francisco gros was seeking a 60-day extension of short-term credit lines from its commercial bank creditors.     the amount of these credit lines totals 15 billion dlrs, and deadline for payment is set for march 31.     finance minister dilson funaro said in a television interview that it was "absolutely important" for brazil and its creditors to renew the short-term credit lines, as brazil must finance its exports.     "if these credit lines were cut, we would face difficulties to honour our foreign debt in the future," funaro said.     "there is evidently a common interest in the matter," he said.     funaro said, however, he was told creditors understand brazil's position and do not wish to make the negotiation for the renewal of the credit lines more difficult.     funaro explained that brazil's suggestion is part of its demands "before the need to renew the mechanisms of loans in the world."     he said that the current negotiating process is "very complex and complicated," mentioning cases of countries which had to wait some 10 months before getting a reply from creditors.     "we are not interested in confrontation, but we would like the loan mechanisms to show that the crisis belongs to both sides," funaro said.     funaro denied rumours that he had offered his resignation to president jose sarney.     "who decides whether to keep or dismiss his ministers is the president. everything else is nothing but speculation," he said.     brazil last month suspended interest payments on its 68- billion dlrs of debt to commercial banks and froze short-term trade and money market lines.  reuter </BODY>

"for a company that's supposed to be under siege, we are doing extremely well. we are exceedingly profitable," a spokesman for the firm told reuters.     the rumors that have swirled around drexel, more than any other broker, have involved concerns that its business will be threatened by the federal probe, say wall street sources. the firm has long been at the leading edge of the mergers business and had ties to now-disgraced speculator ivan boesky.     in the latest chapter of the story, drexel said that some commodities firms have begun to limit the amount of business they will do with the firm, citing credit risks. drexel has long been a powerful competitor in precious metals markets.     but drexel spokesman steve anredder told reuters that drexel's overall business is proceeding normally and the first-quarter profit "could be the strongest of anybody on wall street."     "i wouldn't say we're not feeling any effect (from the trading probes)," he said. "but we're doing extremely well."     the firm was among the first to be subpoenaed in the government's wide-ranging probe of illegal trading involving the use of confidential company information on wall street.     believed to be under particular scrutiny was drexel's "junk bond" operation -- the issuance of high-risk speculative debt that it pioneered for financing corporate takeovers.     "we have done nothing wrong," said the drexel spokesman. "after a thorough investigation, we have found no evidence of any wrongdoing by the firm or anyone within the firm."     the spokesman said that in the aftermath of the boesky arrest, drexel had not been charged. nor had any individual at the firm been charged with illegal acts while employed by drexel. one of its top merger specialists, martin siegel, was charged in connection with a former job.     still, more than any other firm on wall street, drexel has suffered the consequences of the insider trading probe. to begin with, there have been a series of brief shocks in the junk bond market, in nervousness linked to rumors that drexel might be in trouble.     at one point, drexel said wednesday, a large midwest bank refused to allow drexel-issued bonds as collateral on credit lines. two weeks ago, the restriction was withdrawn, it said.     the company also was notified last month that the outside insurer of drexel's individual brokerage accounts had decided not to renew coverage. drexel has set up its own subsidiary handling part of the insurance. american international group and a group of british underwriters have handled the rest.     drexel also appears to have lost ground to others in the mergers and acquisition business recently, market sources said. however, anredder said that there was no sign that drexel had lost any customers at all owing to the insider trading cases. but in citing results for the quarter, the company points mostly to other areas of success.     corporate financings have totaled 8 billion dlrs, including 3 billion dlrs in new junk bonds in the january-march period, drexel said. drexel maintains the lion's share of this lucrative business, trade sources noted.     the market for junk bonds, although jittery, "has rallied back with a vengeance," anredder said.     although they see new competition in the junk bond arena, market sources concur that drexel remains king of the hill.     while some of the leading wall street firms were limiting head-to-head dealings with drexel in the commodity markets  based on worries over the credit of the company, the drexel spokesman called this "ridiculous."  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>members vote to dissolve u.s. farm co-op</TITLE>
<BODY>the shareholders of illinois cooperative futures co voted to dissolve the 26-year-old firm, the futures trading arm of 85 farm cooperatives, its president said.     thomas e. mulligan, president of the board of directors, said 87 pct of the 61 members voting favored dissolution.     the directors recommended the move, citing falling volume and higher costs, when it called a special shareholders meeting last month.     mulligan said the cooperative would continue operating until april 24, when the member cooperatives will have to begin clearing their futures trades through other companies.     mulligan said one of the members, farmers commodities of des moines, iowa, was attempting to organize a new cooperative to replace illinois coop as a clearing company.     sources close to farmers commodities confirmed its plans, but hal richards, president, could not be reached immediately for comment, and it was unknown how many cooperatives might be willing to band together.     industry sources said farmers commodities would face a difficult task in setting up a new clearing organization by april 24, the day illinois cooperative will be dissolved.     they would have to obtain commitments from a sufficient number of cooperatives to meet minimum capital requirements, obtain trading memberships, and set up the office mechanisms to handle futures trading.     in the meantime, commercial clearing firms have been courting the individual coops, trying to obtain their business with low trading rates.     if farmers commodities is unable to set up a clearing organization by april 24, individual members will find other homes, and they're unlikely to change clearing firms a second time, one industry source said.     the demise of illinois coop was set in motion by the withdrawl of growmark, inc., the largest member with more than 70 pct of the capital stock, according to sources within the cooperative.     mulligan acknowledged prior to the vote that growmark had no need to belong to the cooperative since it became affiliated last year with archer daniels midland.     but he said illinois cooperative would still have been able to meet minimum capital requirements without growmark.     the vote to dissolve the organization was met with "a certain amount of pang," he said. "but in the final analysis, the decision has to be economic, not emotional."  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>aluminium scrap recovery and usage to rise</TITLE>
<BODY>aluminium scrap recovery and usage and output of secondary metal will continue to rise, said shearson lehman brothers in a review of the secondary aluminium market which details cost and demand factors.     although primary smelting costs have declined generally in recent years, the still substantial energy cost savings offered by secondary smelters will continue to make re-melted material increasingly attractive.     it takes around 15,000 kilowatt hours (kwh) of electricity to produce one tonne of primary aluminium compared with around 550 kwh for one tonne of secondary metal, shearson said.     on the demand side, developments in automobiles and packaging bode well for secondary aluminium consumption.     automobile production, although expected to fall this year, is still on an upward trend and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future and, in addition, use of aluminium castings is gaining wider acceptance in the automobile industry, particularly in the u.s.     in packaging, shearson does not expect aluminium to dominate the beverage can market in any of the other major economies to the extent it does in the u.s., but says there is evidence recycling is on the increase in other countries.     in addition to the cost savings involved, technology advances now enable alloys of higher purity to be produced by the secondary aluminium industry, shearson said.     there is not likely to be a problem of availability as the u.s. has a huge scrap reservoir and this is also true of several european countries, albeit on a smaller scale.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>china must cut demand, continue reforms, zhao says</TITLE>
<BODY>china must cut excess demand and capital investment in the face of budget and foreign exchange deficits but will press ahead with wide-ranging economic reforms in 1987, premier zhao ziyang told parliament.     zhao told the annual meeting of the national people's congress that while china cooled its overheated economy, cut its trade deficit and raised national living standards in 1986, serious imbalances remain.     zhao said total social demand exceeds total supply, and demand for consumer goods, especially from state firms, is too high. "(they) squander public funds to a serious extent ... (and issue) excessive wage and bonus increases," he said.     failure to cut this excess will "result in reduced accumulation of funds...and serve to corrupt social morality," zhao said. he said there was a contradiction between low per capita incomes and excessively high consumer demand.     china needs to accumulate enormous funds for construction in its initial stage of socialist modernisation and consumption must match the available resources, he said.     zhao said there was a deficit in state finances in 1986 because of the sharp fall in world oil prices, the rising cost of foreign exchange earnings through exports, reduced income from customs duties and unreasonably heavy spending.     local authorities, departments and firms have been able to retain more revenue since economic reforms in 1979. "(they) unjustifiably developed processing industries and non-productive construction," zhao said.     he said that unless effective measures are taken to curb this practice, financial and credit deficits are likely to increase in the next few years.     zhao said that if such deficits become excessive and last too long, they will cause the over-issue of money, which in turn will cause "disturbing inflation, a precipitous rise in commodity prices and chaos in economic life."     another serious problem is that too many new construction projects have been launched. fixed asset investment outside the state plan is over-extended and the pattern of such investment is highly irrational, he said.     investment in energy, transport, telecommunications and raw and semi-finished materials industries is inadequate and investment in non-productive projects is too large, he said.      zhao said some departments and local authorities have failed to take prompt and effective measures to correct this investment imbalance, despite instructions to do so from the state council earlier this year.      he said china's per capita output of grain and other farm and sideline products is still very low and production of grain, forestry, animal husbandry and fisheries rests on a rather weak foundation.      china's countryside is still in the development stage and there is vast potential to be tapped through deep reforms, he said, but did not elaborate.     zhao said the main task for reform in 1987 is to breathe life into china's large and medium sized state firms, which still do not have "a satisfactory combination of responsibilities, powers and benefits."     "we have yet to create conditions for giving the enterprises full managerial authority and full responsibility for their own profits and losses," he said.     currently, the firms are not responding rationally to market changes and doing all the state requires of them, he said. their potential is not being fully tapped, he added.     zhao said that in 1987, china will speed up the reform of its financial system, diversify credit services, encourage competition among different financial institutions and promote insurance services.     he said the system of bank interest rates must be reformed, with differential and floating rates being applied for different periods of time.     china must, under proper guidance, develop markets for the circulation of funds in major cities and exploit the role of financial markets in pooling and regulating funds, he added.     zhao said china must also expand the market for capital goods such as rolled steel, coal, cement and timber. the lack of such a market is the main reason why large state firms have "yet to be fully invigorated," he said.     he also promised a continuation of the labour contract system under which all firms hire workers for a fixed period and pay them according to their own methods, subject only to state-set ceilings for wages and bonuses.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>ual ual, surrounded by takeover speculation</TITLE>
<BODY>ual inc's diversification into hotels and rental cars may be its downfall, analysts said.     digesting its acquisitions of hotels, pan am corp's pacific air routes, and hertz rental cars, combined with stiff air fare competition has left the company with an undervalued stock price, analysts said.     the vulnerability of ual's stock has fueled takeover speculation, as have reports that real estate magnate donald trump has bought a large amount of its stock.     today, a ual executive told reuters its chairman richard ferris spoke with trump last week. trump said his interest in the stock was as an investment, but the executive said the company does not know how much trump owns or whether he has any other plans.     ual senior vice president kurt stocker said the company believes its diversification strategy will work since it can feed customers from one business to another. several weeks ago, it announced the new name of allegis, to be taken in may.     "the strategy that dick ferris was talking about a couple weeks ago when we announced the allegis name is that the whole really ends up to be worth more than the sum of the parts. unfortunately, some people haven't really come to this understanding," stocker said.     but those same parts - westin hotels, hertz rental cars, united airlines and its reservation system - also has wall street calculating a wide range of breakup values from about 100 dlrs per share to 130 dlrs per share.     analysts aren't so sure the strategy is going to work. they mention transworld corp, initially trans world airlines, as an example of an airline diversification gone wrong. transworld corp ended up spinning off its twa airline. transworld, now tw services, is selling hilton international to ual.     "if you want to be negatively biased you say it's a stupid philosophy, and if you're united and you put billions of dlrs into other acquisitions, this is a good idea. there's not much evidence one way or the other," said dean witter analyst mark daugherty.     "in the short or long run, they all (ual's businesses) make money and perform well," said stocker. he said the stock price hasn't caught on since the strategy is relatively new.     analysts say it's because earnings are relatively poor. earnings last year were 25 cts per share. louis marckesano of janney montgomery predicts 1987 net of 3.50 dlrs per share.     "they're potential is enormous. i think their problem has been execution. the strike was the single biggest factor that set them back in 1985. last year, the whole industry was involved in fare wars. they were hit harder by the fare wars than anyone else," said marckesano.     marckesano said united airlines was particularly hurt by the fare wars because it shares a denver hub with texas air corp's price-slashing continental airlines.     analysts said the same strategy which has contributed to an undervalued stock price may also result in a strong takeover defense. they said ual paid a lot for some of its assets and that in itself may make the company undesireable.     "i think they have a fairly tough management that will at least be able to do battle with a potential shark and may well be able to defeat them. these guys aren't pushovers," said steve lewins, an airline analyst at citicorp.     lewins believes the company could ultimately boost the stock price to a level that would reflect its assets, but it will take time and improvements in earnings.     "if they put their nose to the grindstone, we're talking about years for anyone (in the airline industry)," he said. "the whole unwinding of the battle of texas air is going to take years, establishing the pacific in competition with (nwa inc nwa,) northwest is going to take until 1990," lewins said.      ual today rose 2-1/2 to 62-1/2 on heavy volume of 1.9 mln shares.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>singapore laws to liberalise local capital market</TITLE>
<BODY>parliament passed laws increasing the amounts and frequency of treasury bill issues and allowing the government to raise up to 35 billion dlrs through issues of registered stock, bearer bonds and book-entry securities.     both steps are aimed at establishing a wider domestic capital market as part of singapore's plans to expand its financial sector, finance minister richard hu said.     banking sources said the new government securities market, scheduled to have been launched on march 2, had been delayed pending legislative approval of these bills.     the 35 billion dlrs maximum which may be raised under the development loan bill (1987), against a ceiling of 15 billion under current laws, is expected to satisfy demand for government securities over the next four years, hu said.     he said 6.1 billion dlrs of the 15 billion has so far been raised as development loans. the rest will be used up when bonds are issued to absorb advance deposits of 13.9 billion dlrs from the central provident fund (cpf), a mandatory pension savings scheme. workers and employers contribute a respective 25 pct and 10 pct of a worker's salary to the cpf, which had funds totalling 29.3 billion at end-1986.     regular government securities issues are needed to meet the demand of banks, insurance companies, other financial institutions and corporate and individual investors, hu said.     the monetary authority of singapore (mas) had said it planned to launch trading by issuing taxable instruments grossing seven billion dlrs in the first year and a gross 38 billion dlrs of paper over the next five years.     funds raised in excess of the government's budgetary needs will not be channelled into increased spending, but will be recycled back to the financial system, largely through the mas, hu said.     hu said the current government securities market is rudimentary, with the cpf holding three-quarters of the outstanding debt and banks, discount houses and insurance companies holding the rest. "the concentration of securities in the hands of such long-term holders has left little scope for trading activity," he said.     "moreover, the maturity of the bonds, mostly 20 years, was not attractive to other investors who might have been expected to deal more actively in the market. the infrequency of bond issues exacerbated the lack of liquidity necessary for the development of a market," hu said.     hu said these obstacles have been resolved and regular issues of government securities will be made, initially carrying terms of up to five years and market-related yields.     the minimum denomination is 1,000 dlrs for notes and bonds -- aimed at individual investors -- and 10,000 dlrs for the treasury bills, which are directed at corporate investors.     eight primary and registered dealers have undertaken to make markets in order to ensure liquidity, he said.     hu said while the new government securities market will be essentially domestic, non-residents are free to invest, but interest earned will be subject to withholding tax.     hu said under the new treasury bills (amendment) bill, all book entries of borrowings through treasury bill issues must be made in records maintained by mas.     hu said that instead of physical certificates having to travel back and forth at each transaction, with side trips to the mas for registration, the mas will maintain a computerised system for updating records in a central register.     commercial banks and primary and registered government securities dealers will each have two securities accounts with the mas, one for their own holdings and the other for holdings on behalf of all their customers, hu said.     all trades will be reflected daily in changes in these accounts, hu said.     "these institutions will in turn act as custodians of government securities for their customers, rendering each an individual accounting of his holdings."     hu said the new system will cut storage and handling costs and paper work, reduce the danger of loss, theft, destruction and counterfeiting, and permit greater speed and efficiency in handling large volumes of transactions.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>bank of thailand plans its first bond issue</TITLE>
<BODY>the bank of thailand is seeking finance ministry approval to issue its first bond, central bank sources said.     the planned three billion baht issue would carry a term of six months to one year as a short term move to mop up surplus funds held by commercial banks.     the issue would offer a coupon attractive to commercial banks, which currently have an estimated 30 to 60 billion baht in funds invested in low-yield securities, the sources said.     the central bank, charged with supervision of commercial banks, has previously issued only finance ministry bonds.     private bankers said they are awaiting a central bank decision on whether to allow commercial banks to continue holding up to 40 pct of their capital in foreign exchange or to return it to 20 pct as scheduled.     the six month 40 pct ceiling expires april 6 but the banks want it extended for six more months.     they said a forced cut in foreign exchange positions would worsen the local liquidity problem as commercial banks would have to convert about five billion baht worth of foreign currencies in their portfolios into baht.     senior central bank officials suggested to reporters last week that the foreign exchange ceiling will be lowered to discourage banks' use of excess funds for currency speculation.     central bank sources said some commercial banks, anticipating such a central bank decision, have been converting their foreign currencies into baht this week and lending the additional funds to the bank of thailand's short-term loan repurchase facility.     they said the bank of thailand's repurchase window yesterday received offers of about three billion baht of investment funds from commercial banks, three times its normal daily amount.     the repurchase window uses government bonds as an instrument with which commercial banks can borrow from or lend to the state bank.     the facility is sometimes used by the central bank to set a local short-term interest benchmark through fixing its bond repurchase rates.  reuter </BODY>

"during the spring selling season, you usually look for some kind of seasonal uplift in sales. it doesn't look like it's happening," said joseph philippi, analyst with e.f. hutton and co.     "there may be less bloom to the spring selling season this year than last," one auto company official conceded.     general motors corp gm>, still working to regain consumer interest in its cars, led the drop with a 14.8 pct decline.     ford motor co's f> sales increased 15.2 pct for the period. but analysts said the rise compares to a 1986 period for ford, leaving it down 10 pct in two years.     "the total industry (mid-march sales) was slightly less than expected," the company official said.     american motors' decline caught analysts eye. "american motors took it on the chin--big," said philippi.     given the prospective takeover by chrysler, "people might be a little leary about going to (american motors) dealers," he said.     american motors sold 790 domestic cars in the period, meaning each of american motors 1,050 dealers "is selling a car about every other day," philippi said.     potential american motors buyers are afraid their car models "might disappear," he said.     chrysler, in its purchase agreement with american motors' majority stockholder renault>, has agreed not to undercut sales of american motors' new medallion and premier cars, made by renault.     on a company by company basis, sales of u.s. made cars from the march 11 to 20 period were--gm 105,438, down 14.8 pct, ford 67,672, up 15.2 pct, chrysler 30,909, down 3.6 pct, american motors 790, down 6.2 pct, american honda 7,447 compared with 5,031, nissan motor corp, 3,358, up 10.7 pct, volkswagon u.s. inc 1,330, down 35 pct.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>world bank president barber conable said he was concerned about the state of brazil's economy and urged the country to come up with a plan soon to put its economic house in order.     "i am very concerned about the brazilian economy," he told reporters after a news conference in tokyo.     he said brazil had caught the attention of the world with its decision last month to stop paying interest on its loans from commercial banks but warned it not to sqaunder the time it gained by failing to come up with a new economic program.     brazil's decision jolted the world's financial community as the country is 108 billion dlrs in debt, including some 68 billion owed to commercial banks.     brazilian finance ministry sources said in brasilia yesterday that the country was preparing a new economic strategy designed to ensure domestic economic growth.     despite mounting domestic and overseas pressure, brazil has said repeatedly that it will not go to the international monetary fund (imf) for help in drawing up a new plan for fear that will only throw its economy into recession.     conable said the country may be able to get away with not going to the imf for help, but will need an imf-type economic program if it wants to regain the confidence of lenders.     outsiders like the world bank are reluctant to suggest possible solutions to brazil's economic problems because of the delicate political situation there, he added.     while the world bank has a role to play in helping brazil, it canot replace the imf as an overseer of the economy, conable said. he added that the fund can be very flexible in its dealings with developing countries, adjusting its approach to the political realities.     brazil still seems willing to talk to the fund under the annual discussions that all imf members undertake, conable said, adding that this could partially solve the current stalemate.     during his news conference, conable said the world bank backed u.s. treasury secretary james baker's third world debt initiative, which calls for stepped up lending to heavily indebted third world countries adopting economic policies.     "the world bank believes the baker initiative is the best approach," he said. "debt forgiveness is difficult to design in any fair way and also will tend to discourage further investment and development."     he cited the recent multi-billion dollar debt package for mexico, the third world's most indebted country after brazil.     "will it work?" he asked. "we don't know...but we think it more likely to work than any of the alternatives suggested."     conable, who is here to meet government and business leaders, expressed confidence that japan will make increasing use of its huge trade surplus to help developing countries.     "we are quite confident japan will make an increasing investment in development because of their willingness to support institutions like ours in increasing ways with each passing year," he said.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>gencorp gy, bid could be raised, group says</TITLE>
<BODY>an investor group said it might be willing to raise its 100 dlr per share offer for gencorp but so far the company has turned down requests for a meeting.     "we might be able to see some additional value if we could meet" and get more financial data, said joel reed, speaking for the investor group.     reed told reuters that gencorp chairman a. william reynolds "was not interested in sitting down and talking with us at this time." cyril wagner sought the meeting in a recent telephone conversation with reynolds, reed said.     wagner and brown, along with afg industries inc afg,, recently launched a surprise tender offer for gencorp. the offer is worth 2.23 billion dlrs.     reed said under the circumstances the 100 dlr per share tender offer, which expires april 15, is a fair offer. gencorp gained 3-1/2 to 114 today on the nyse.     reed outlined a plan to reshape gencorp in the event his group wins control. he said aerospace, soft drink bottling and entertainment units are potential divestiture candidates. he said the tire business, which the group wants to keep, may be more viable if merged with another tire company.     "one option would be to try to grow the tire business through combination or an acquisition," reed said. he said he believes such a merger could create a stronger force in the tire industry.     gary miller, chief financial officer of afg, said his company has a record of acquiring mature businesses and boosting productivity. automation and incentives tied to profit sharing have been used with success, he said.     in the case of gencorp's rko general broadcasting stations, reed said the plan of the partners is to step into gencorp's shoes and proceed with plans to  sell the stations.     the partners said if they succed in acquiring gencorp they intend to consummate sale of wor-tv in new york to mca inc mca>. gencorp last year entered into an agreement to sell the station for 387 mln dlrs.     the partners also said if they acquire gencorp they would also proceed with the proposed sale of khj-tv in los angeles to walt disney co dis>. rko general would receive 217 mln dlrs and fidelilty television, which challenged the license, would get about 103 mln dlrs.     the partners also said the federal communications commission established an expedited schedule for receiving comments on their request for special temporary authorization of proposed trust arrangements while the fcc considers a formal application for transfer of the broadcast unit.     reed said he was pleased with the expedited schedule because it provides time for the agency to act on the request before the expiration of the tender offer.     he said it was the aim of the partners to move as quickly as possible to eliminate uncertainty surrounding the stations.     asked about criticism of the takeover attempt voiced by some municipal officials in akron, ohio, where gencorp is headquartered, reed said, "the plan of the partners offers long term growth for ohio."     he noted that the aerospace business, slated for divestiture under the partners' plan, is located in california. "our program is one that overall would provide the greatest long term growth for all segments," he said.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>philippines to put 100 state firms up for sale</TITLE>
<BODY>the head of a philippine panel charged with selling the non-performing assets of government financial institutions said some 100 state-owned companies would also be put up for privatisation.     but david sycip, chief executive trustee of the asset privatisation trust (apt), told a meeting of financial executives the apt has not yet received a list of the firms.     "i believe lead investor groups, people who see long-term potential, are willing to buy such companies in full and do a hands-on job of running them," sycip said.     sycip said open bidding would be used to sell all assets handled by the apt. he said bidding would be either open-priced, if there were enough serious contenders, or the apt would set a target price for acquisition. he added that the target price did not constitute a rigid floor.     "what we consider an acceptable price is a price at which an investor will earn an adequate return," he said.     sycip said the bulk of the apt's current work relates to the non-performing assets of the state-owned development bank of the philippines (dbp) and the philippine national bank (pnb). the apt was set up in january.     sycip said about 75 pct of the 400-odd assets that the dbp and the pnb are handing over to the apt are still in the form of financial assets.     "in some cases financial assets have been converted into physical assets by foreclosures. they are fairly cut and dried because we are dealing with mostly whole production facilities like textile or food-processing plants," he said.     "financial assets are more complicated. the only recourse is to foreclose, gain titles, and try to sell the asset, but the laws here tend to favour the debtors," he added.     sycip said although the apt is protected from prosecution by its charter, many debtors are tying up the panel with litigation.     "if you see some of the situations we have to work our way through you will see that our symbol, a gordian knot, is an apt illustration," he said.     sycip said the pnb has not succeeded in foreclosing on 16 of the 17 sugar factories it wants to sell because of the high costs involved. "when you do your arithmetic you realise that if you did foreclose your recovery would be only a fraction of the asset's book exposure," he said.     sycip said the apt was not worried about whether associates of former president ferdinand marcos, who originally owned many of the bankrupt companies, would buy them back through the privatisation scheme.     "we just look at the bottom line, which is to monetise these assets to the maximum degree possible," he said. "we are selling for cash, it is not our concern where it comes from."     he said he had told cabinet ministers sceptical about the identities of buyers that "marcos cronies" could easily put up legitimate fronts if they were specifically barred from bidding for assets on the block.     "i told them if i am paid 20 mln pesos in 100-peso bills, all with identical serial numbers and they look like genuine legal currency, then i would accept them'," sycip said.     he said some participants in the government's debt-equity swap scheme were interested in buying non-performing assets with the pesos they receive from such deals. the problem is government regulations slow down approval of debt-equity plans and the apt normally demands full payment within 15 days.     "the central bank and monetary board could also look at investment funds earmarked for non-performing asset purchases," he said. "it would greatly facilitate matters."     sycip said last month the apt hoped to recover about 24 billion pesos of the assets' total worth of 108 billion.     president corazon aquino announced earlier this month that proceeds from the sale of apt-controlled assets would be used to finance the government's land reform program, which aims to distribute about 9.7 mln hectares of land to poor peasants.     asked why the apt did not favour filipino buyers, sycip said: "how much money has the country to lose because of this 'filipinos first' slogan? how many people have become millionaires and then forgotten the philippines and put their money in the united states or australia?"  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>london on rise as trading centre in u.s. debt</TITLE>
<BODY>london's rise as a trading centre for u.s. government debt has been spurred by the increasing use of interest rate swaps, which are now arranged for most new issues in the eurobond markets, traders and analysts said.     indeed, eurobond traders estimate that about 80 pct of all new debt issued here last year -- over 186 billion dlrs worth -- was part of either an interest rate or currency swap.     "the u.s. treasuries market here is swap-driven," said david jones, vice president at goldman sachs and co international and head of its u.s. government bond trading desk.     "it is commonplace to have trades of 100 mln dlrs or more in 10-years, seven years or five years, all related to an interest rate swap or hedging of a eurobond deal," jones said at a recent conference on the u.s. treasuries market.     just a year or so ago, he said, trades of that size going through brokers screens in london were unthinkable.     traders said that over the past two weeks, while trading in u.s. treasuries has been almost frozen by indecision over the direction of interest rates, swap-related deals have provided the sole source of new business.     dealers said that last week, a 260 mln dlr trade involving two and 10-year treasuries was transacted on brokers' screens.     the trade, they said, was swap related.     there are no firm figures on exactly how much u.s. treasury debt is traded here and estimates vary widely.     but wrightson economics, a u.s.-based research firm which drew its data from u.s. treasury reports, estimated that gross transactions in u.s. government securities in london rose to 341 billion dlrs in the first nine months of 1986 alone, against 188 billion in all of 1985.     wrightson estimates that about 20 pct of all u.s. treasury trading is transacted outside the u.s., with tokyo forming the third major centre.     and while figures are not yet available for the last quarter, the anecdotal evidence suggests that the trend continued, traders say.     richard lacy, chief executive at exco international, put average daily treasuries trading volume in london at about 15 billion dlrs. exco recently purchased an 80 pct interest in rmj securities inc, one of the four major brokers in u.s. government bonds which has offices in london, new york and tokyo.     but dick van splinter, president of rmj's competitor, fundamental brokers inc's london operations, estimates average daily turnover is no more than four to five billion dlrs.     but even at the low range of estimates, treasuries trading volume is at least equal to that in the u.k.'s own government bonds, known as gilts.      jeremy ford, vice president at bankers trust international ltd, explained that u.s. treasuries are used by intermediaries in swap transactions to lock in the "spread," the difference between the interest rate the borrower has to pay and the rate that the counterparty is obliged to pay.     but even beyond swap-related activity, dealers said the nature of trading in london has changed.     "the interesting thing our figures show is the transition in london from a marketing effort to a trading effort," said louis crandall, an economist at wrightson who has been collecting the data.     crandall said that previously, firms' activities were limited to trying to sell u.s. securities to european investors. now, however, they appear increasingly willing act as principal in transactions rather than acting on behalf of their new york offices.     increasingly, traders say, firms maintain separate profit and loss sheets for their london operations so that trading decisions can be made independently from the u.s. headquarters.     many of the major u.s. firms, including merrill lynch and co, shearson lehman brothers inc and chemical bank trade for their own accounts here.     also, traders point out, the number of u.s. firms operating in london has increased sharply over the past year, as has the number of european and asian banks which trade u.s. government securities.     within the past few months, national westminster bank plc's county bank subsidiary and swiss bank corp have applied to the federal reserve bank of new york to become primary dealers in u.s. government securities and their london offices have just recently received direct-dealing brokers screens.     and donaldson lufkin jenrette, already a primary dealer, is preparing to open a u.s. treasuries trading desk in london.     dick van splinter, president of fundamental brokers inc, the largest of the four major government bond brokers here, said he now has 45 firms using direct-dealing screens, up from 35 a year ago.  reuter </BODY>

"we just want to stick to the agreement which was reached, and that was very clear -- that the new round would be one undertaking. it is a global negotiation with no two tracks, no fast track, no slow track. it has just one track, the track - and that's all," de clercq said.

<BODY>resorts international inc said it received a proposal from ksz co inc, under which holders of resorts class b stock would receive 140 dlrs a share in cash and one share of common stock in a new company to be formed through the takeover.     under the offer, resorts said holders of its class a shares would receive 15 dlrs a share in cash and three shares of common stock in the new company.     resorts said the offer from ksz calls for a merger of resorts with ri acquisition co inc, a newly formed delaware corporation.     resorts said that prior to the merger, ri acquisition would be capitalized with about 100 mln dlrs of debt and about 220 mln dlrs of equity.     it said 200 mln dlrs of the equity would be in the form of special preferred stock.     the ksz offer, resorts said, indicates that ksz has a commitment from m. davies cos> to buy all of the special preferred stock.     resorts said the offer will expire at 1700 est on march 27. it said it asked its investment advisor, bear, stearns and co, to advise its board on the offer.     earlier this month, the estate of james m. crosby and certian members of his family agreed to sell their class b shares to new york real estate tycoon donald trump for 135 dlrs a share. the estate and family members hold 78 pct of the 752,297 class b shares outstanding.     trump also agreed to pay 135 dlrs a share for the remaining class b shares outstanding.     resorts also has about 5,680,000 shares of outstanding class a stock. these shares carry one one-hundredth the voting power of the class b shares.     trump's offer beat out a rival bid of 135 dlrs a share made by pratt hotel corp prat>.     resorts said that under the proposal made by ksz, existing class a and class b shareholders would control about 96 pct of the outstanding common of the new company formed to acquire resorts.     resorts said the new company, upon completion of the merger, would hold the 220 mln dlrs of debt and that the special preferred stock would immediately be converted into exchangeable participating preferred of the new company.     this preferred, resorts said, would pay a dividend based on the net cash flows from the new company's paradise island operations.     a resorts spokesman said the ksz offer was made in a two-page letter and that resorts could not comment on it because it did not contain enough information. resorts has asked bear, sterns to obtain complete data, he said.     the spokesman said resorts is not familiar with ksz but that it believes the company is controlled by marvin davis, the denver oilman.     calls to davis were referred to lee solters, who handles public relations for davis. solters, said to be travelling, was not immediately available for comment.     donald trump was also unavailable for comment, as was a spokesman for the crosby estate.  reuter </BODY>

<BODY>britain has decided to resist u.s. pressure and retain powers to withdraw tax credits from u.s. parent companies based in states which impose unitary taxes on the worldwide profits of foreign-owned firms, treasury financial secretary norman lamont told parliament.     but he added that the eventual use of those powers would not be backdated if activated before the end of 1988.     the u.k. government has consistently opposed the use of unitary taxation of international business on grounds they are contrary to internationally accepted principles, laid down by the united nations and the oecd, treasury sources said.     in a written parliamentary answer, lamont said "in the meantime, progress towards a final resolution of the unitary tax issues will be kept under careful review" by britain.     "should it be necessary to take action ... before december 31, 1988, it will not apply to dividends paid before the date of the announcement of such action. if it is necessary to take action thereafter, it will not apply to dividends on or before december 31, 1988," lamont said.     the reagan administratian published draft legislation late in 1985 to limit states use of unitary taxation to the profits made inside the u.s., known as the "water's edge" method.     in response to that draft legislation, britain agreed to defer initiating action under its finance act 1985 - but only on the understanding that legislation to resolve the unitary tax issue would be made law and take effect from end-december 1986.     then the u.s. administration said in september 1986 that it had decided not to pursue federal legislation, in view of the passing of legislation in california.     britain, however, considers the california legislation unsatisfactory, not least because u.k. business will have to pay a fee for the right of not being assessed by the unitary tax method, government sources said.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>economic spotlight - tokyo earthquake aftershocks</TITLE>
<BODY>the possibility that a major earthquake will strike tokyo, causing corporate and financial ruin, haunts the worst nightmares of many insurers and bankers polled by reuters.     the japanese capital is shaken by hundreds of small tremors every year, but last week's biq quake in western japan, which measured 6.9 on the open-ended richter scale, was a timely reminder that the big one could come at any time.     another on tuesday registering a preliminary 6.5 on the scale struck the sea of japan coast northwest of tokyo.     a widely accepted theory by the late seismologist kawasumi hiroshi states that major quakes occur in cycles averaging 69 years. tokyo was last laid flat in 1923 by a tremor reading 7.8, raising the spectre of another within five years.     seismic experts at shizuoka, one of three areas near tokyo considered quake-prone, say they expect a major earthquake within the next few years.     added to such fears is the fact that no developed nation has suffered a major quake since the far-reaching changes in the last two decades which have bound the global economy into a complex, fragile, interdependent financial network.     "we are reaching a dangerous time. insurance companies are starting to worry about how to cover the large losses," said hatsuho narita, a manager at the british insurance group.     "it's a theme that has worried a lot of people. it's difficult to put a figure on it, but the impact on all world markets would be considerable," brian waterhouse, a banking expert at brokerage james capel in tokyo, told reuters.     what would happen?     consider that tokyo and its six surrounding prefectures account for up to 40 pct of japanese gross national product, or some six pct of world gnp.     some economists believe that in the immediate aftermath of a tokyo quake, the yen would rise against sterling because of the large amount of reinsurance which would fall due in london. but it would plunge against other currencies.     this would worsen the dramatic loss of value in land and assets in the tokyo area. banks would be left holding hundreds of billions of dollars in worthless mortgages and loans.     bankers estimate that 50 to 70 pct of city and regional banks' loan exposure is to smaller business, which would most likely lose all in a quake. up to nine pct of their exposure is in housing and consumer loans, they said.     many smaller banks and some larger ones would go to the wall, bankers polled by reuters said.     the government, aware that insurance claims would be huge, has set a payout ceiling of 10 mln yen per private house. in tokyo, 100 mln yen buys only a very modest residence.     in addition, the insurance industry has formed the japan earthquake reinsurance co to cover housing to a total of 10 billion dlrs, 80 pct of it government-guaranteed.     however, insurers said the industrial sector, which has no government backing, is a more dangerous risk.     japanese insurers said they are finding it increasingly difficult to find reinsurance abroad.     "overseas firms are now very alert to earthquake insurance risks," said tahashi kumakiri, foreign department head at the japan non-life insurance association.     due to limited world insurance capacity, the finance ministry recommends a coverage limit of 15 to 30 pct of japanese firms' total insurable value.     even so, one insurer believes that local firms reinsure up to 80 pct of their quake cover overseas, most of it through lloyds of london.     some of this reinsurance is then reinsured again, compounding the risks should the money suddenly be called in.     foreign entities in japan are allowed 100 pct quake cover but foreign insurers now set a limit of 60 pct.     industrial cover is confidential but official figures show that in fiscal 1985/86 ended march 31, japan did about half a billion dlrs of overseas reinsurance business in fire cover, most of which is quake-related.     bankers said the destruction of underlying assets and repatriation of huge amounts of japanese overseas investment would seriously affect overseas stock and bond markets.     japanese institutions buy a net 10 billion dlrs or so of foreign bonds a month, much of it u.s. treasuries, and are purchasing more and more u.s. and european stocks. the value of foreign holdings of japanese securities would nosedive.     japan would need huge amounts of money over a long period to rebuild, which would block out developing nation creditors from existing capital resources, the bankers said.     loss of central computers would mean billions in lost transactions, bankers noted.     oil traders said crude prices would plummet as imports fell by up to half from some three mln barrels per day now.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>first interstate seeks acquisition</TITLE>
<BODY>less than two months after first interstate bancorp withdrew its bold attempt to buy bankamerica corp, chairman joseph pinola is still looking for a good buy, but he is also looking at ways to avoid being bought.     in a wide-ranging interview, pinola said he's looking for ways to improve profitability and capital between now and 1991, "so as to resist any potential look at us...to maintain our independence, if possible."     in 1991 federal regulatory changes will allow the major east coast banks to buy banks in california.     first interstate, the fourth largest california bank, and the nineth largest nationwide, owns 24 banks in 12 western states and has franchise operations in four additional states.     bank industry sources say it is an attractive target for large u.s. or foreign banks, looking to quickly move into the  lucrative california market and the west coast region.     while declining specifics on his corporate strategy, when asked if acquisitions will be part of the plan, pinola replied, "that's undoubtedly a fair statement...it would be almost naive not to think that."     pinola characterized his acquisition strategy as "opportunistic".     he said he will look for banks in management trouble that he can get at a bargain, then add management to restore profitability, or for banks in states where first interstate already operates, then cut costs by combining resources.     the exception, he said, would be texas, where he said most of the banks are already well managed, but might be purchased at a discount because of the depressed regional economy.     pinola declined comment on what circumstances might move him to rekindle his bid for bankamerica, saying only, "we continue to monitor and look at a lot of things and a lot of people continue to monitor and look at us."     banking analysts, however, consider another first interstate bid at bankamerica a long shot, not likely to happen any time soon.     pinola called his decision last month to withdraw his 3.25 billion dlr bid at the nation's second largest bank, "a very, very difficult decision."     with that decision made, however, he acknowledged first interstate may now have a difficult time keeping its number four position in the california banking community.     "the competition in this state is tough," he said, noting citybank's recent purchase of 50 financial service branches from sears roebuck company. "citybank is moving rapidly to move us down to fifth and wells fargo down to fourth," he said.     outside california, pinola acknowledged that security pacific corp, with its recent acquisitions in arizona, washington and oregon, is quickly becoming a regional competitor in areas where first interstate has long dominated.     "security is, has been and continues to be a highly profitable and obviously well managed company," he said.     he added, however, first interstate, at the moment, has the advantages of having owned and managed regional banks longer and has the recognition advantage of having given its regional banks a common name.     pinola said while its coastal state banks are in good financial condition, first interstate continues to sustain serious loan losses in its rocky mountain states, where energy, real estate and agriculture dominate the economy.     asked if he thought loan losses in those areas had peaked, he said, "i don't think it has bottomed out, because i think most of the problems are real estate-related and the real estate problems are going to be with us for several years."     pinola said another failing economic sector, agriculture in the midwest, has slowed expansion of first interstate's franchise operation.     first interstate has 42 franchise banks that offer first interstate financial services in ten states.     while a year ago he was considering taking his franchise operation east of the mississippi river, pinola said because most of the franchise banks are now in the west, expansion into the midwest must come first.     calling the franchise system, "moderately profitable," pinola said, "it is going to take a rejuvenation of the agriculture sector for us to commence franchising at the speed we were generating before the last year or two."     on the banking industry in general, pinola said he thinks 1987 will be another bad year for loan losses, with only banks with minimal holdings in real estate able to improve profits.  reuter </BODY>

<TITLE>oil analyst sees papua new guinea as good prospect</TITLE>
<BODY>papua new guinea (png) provides the most exciting new prospect in the asia-pacific region for oil production, energy analyst fereidun fesharaki said here.     the recent successful find at iagifu is likely to put png on the list of major oil exporters by the early 1990s, he told the australian petroleum exploration association annual conference.     fesharaki, leader of the energy program at the east-west center in honolulu, hawaii, was speaking on the asia-pacific petroleum outlook.     with domestic demand of around 12,000 barrels per day (bpd) and prospects of production of over 100,000 bpd by late 1991, png would become an ecuador-level crude exporter, fesharaki said.     the iagifu wells in the papuan basin have recorded the best oil flows in more than 60 years of exploration in png.     the png government's geological survey in a paper distributed at the conference estimates iagifu reserves at about 500 mln barrels.     png enjoys the most liberal tax regime in the region with no secondary taxes, fesharaki said.     "we expect a much larger oil search in papua new guinea, and discovery of much larger volumes of oil, similar in quality to (light) bass strait crude," fesharaki said.     there are also large pockets of high quality condensates to be produced, notably in the juha field near iagifu which is capable of producing 30,000 to 40,000 bpd, he said.     but prices should be somewhat higher than the present levels to justify development of the juha field, he said.     the png geological survey paper noted there are five large prospective but little-explored sedimentary basins in png.  reuter </BODY>
